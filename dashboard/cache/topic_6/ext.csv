"Took this in 2018 with no programming experience ever. Started out pretty slow, but I didn't really pay attention and was severely behind. Went to a lot of office hours, but nonetheless caught up and did decently well. After taking more cs courses, racket really is a weird language.",Wokia Kumase = GOAT,"Interesting material, but truly quite difficult. Takes a lot of practice, especially before major assessments, so keeping on top of assignments and quizzes helps a lot.",This course is interesting and easy before the midterm. Still interesting after the midterm but it is super hard. I took it twice and still couldn't get a good grade,"SO easy, didn't pay attention in the lectures, just used course notes.",This course teaches proof techniques which I assume that will be used a lot in future math courses and ended with lots of calculation. It was neither hard nor hard but I learned how to manage time wisely (took some time to get used to first-year university math tho).
"math student who took this course since I had 0 prior programming experience. the course isn't horribly hard, but if you fall behind or don't understand one lesson, everything following will be super challenging. the course was mostly online completing modules, and my biggest criticism is that solutions for lessons are never posted after they are due which makes it super challenging to do the next week's module if you didn't understand/didnt know how to write a specific code for the week. the racket language used in this course is easy to follow but not very useful and isn't used anywhere. this makes it difficult to find help outside of cs115 profs/ta's/past cs115 students. the course is oddly paced, felt the super easy and simple first half of the course, and then gets unreasonably fast. didn't find any of the profs/ta's answers to questions posted on discussion boards useful at all. because the course was only offered online, I had to essentially had to teach the whole course to myself",Very easy course if you keep up with the material and do the assignments.,Interesting course. Assignments can be challenging so start those as soon as possible. Midterm and Final were straightforward.,Useful course. Assignments get a lot harder after the midterm.,Honestly a really straightforward and boring class. Reading the textbook was a much bigger help than attending lectures. Midterms were easy if you made notes and understood the concepts.,It's a great course. Well organized and building a fundamental basis for our mathematical intuition. It also combines how the elegance of writing and math.
"Nice course that teaches you how to write simple code. But little annoying that you have to do Design Recipe (especially writing an explanation for codes). There is no loop in DrRacket so being able to understand recursion is important. All course contents are based on a website and you have to read everything and code something on that website. Pity that this course will not show many algorithms or data structures. So far I think those who can just play computer games (i.e. no coding experience but can easily type using the keyboard) can easily get 90+ in this course. If you have ever coded like C, python, java, pascal and so on, easy to get 95+. Idk why the easy rate goes so low but trust me, super easy course if you finish reading the material (okay reading part may be a little boring and CS 135 provide detailed intros which seem not wordy)","So Easy. Just follow the course notes. It literally tells you how to do everything you need to do. Assignments take some time, so leave a few hours aside for them. Otherwise this class is super easy.","Very useful course. Really enjoyed applying proof techniques to different questions. Although somewhere around (Assignment 4+), assignment difficulty went from stupidly easy to incredibly difficult and it could take upwards of 15 hours to complete a problem set.","This course isn't easy. It takes a lot of hard work from your end to get a good mark. As the semester progresses, the concepts get harder. That is, at first, they can sound very confusing and intimidating. However, with a lot of practice and patience, you can relate to the topics more effectively. The proofs come to you with patience. Don't get discouraged if you are not able to solve them right away.","Other than some of the oligarchy content and some of the material in the beginning, this course was just a knowledge dump of a bunch of microeconomic content. You won't retain anything that you learn at all. quizzes/exams were multiple choice, which weren't too bad if you took it online. Mark also consisted of 2 discussion boards, which were engaging (but you get penalized if someone responds to your post 30 minutes before its due and you don't reply back because its 11pm at night)","This course is great for anyone that is interested in math. It is quite different from high school math courses, as it is a whole new way of approaching mathematical problems. The course goes over techniques of proofs, which are the building blocks of many future math courses. The later half of the course goes over some number theory, I found it sufficiently challenging but still interesting. In terms of course load there are weekly assignments, but they are not too bad if you start early, and you are allowed to ask instructors for help. Be warned that the exams are fairly difficult though. Overall, a great course for any math enthusiasts to take."
"Not a bird course, although if you have background in programming it would not be difficult at all. Racket is somewhat useless but I learned some concepts that will be useful for other programming languages","This course is all about writing proofs. Most of the concepts were super interesting but writing the proofs was challenging. The course is designed really well as each chapter flows into the next, so you really understand the connections. Do the assignments yourself and try to do the extra practice before midterms and finals. I personally loved this course!",The most difficult course in my 1A. Really suffered.,"Course was easy until immediately after the midterm, where it suddenly ramped up in difficulty (RSA in particular threw me for a loop). Assignments were much harder than any of the exams, so don't be discouraged if you can't do them. People hype this course up - it's challenging, but not impossible to do well in.","do not take this as an elective unless coding/math is easy for you! there are a lot of concepts, impossible to teach yourself from the course notes because of how poorly organized they are. lectures are impossibly boring. My best friend tutors this class and I still justtttt scraped by. language is not super useful in life. many of my friends have taken this course because they heard it was easy and ended up failing.","Interesting topic, first time seeing proofs like this maybe useful for upper year math courses. Very difficult in-person but online is much easier, grading is unfair and depends on the prof (some profs gave extra bonus questions, etc). Pick Anton’s class if you can he is the best."
"One of my least favourite courses. Although things were nicely organized, Racket was such an annoying language to use. The one tangible benefit I felt after using Racket was feeling more comfortable with recursion.",For someone with no history in writing programs this was a very cool course. Lectures were difficult to pay attention to but I liked the overall skill set I came out of the course with. Also learned that coding can be very frustrating (you can easily get stuck at a road block for significant amounts of time) yet very rewarding (no better feeling than finally getting your program to run),Interesting course was generally fun to learn its contents. Assignments were more difficult than midterm though...,"Materials before the midterm were very easy, the course gets a bit harder after the midterm. But if you do all your assignments, you should be able to do well on the exam easily.","Didn’t take any econ courses in high school. This course was really easy, no need to read the textbook, the course notes are enough. You get 12 weekly quizzes, 2 group discussions, 1 midterm and the final. The first weekly quiz is ungraded and then the marks of 10 best quizzes out of 11 are considered which amounts to 40% of your grade. We also have 2 group discussions worth 10% each which are very easy. You can easily get a 9/10 in the discussions. The midterm contained 50mcq and the final consisted of 50mcqs and 5 short answer questions. Prof kumase did some review sessions on webex occasionally. These are recorded and can help you understand the concepts more clearly. It’s definitely a bird course. Spent only about a maximum of 4-5 hours per week. Ended up with a 93.",Very interesting and useful course. Pay attention to the lectures as some of the content will show up in upper year math courses.
Really easy course. Especially if you have coded before. Assignments get a little harder at the end but both the midterm and finals were easy. The only thing I hated about this course was how annoying using Dr. Racket can be at times.,"The most disgusting piece of content that I have ever learnt in my life. This course is so useless and unnecessarily complicated. The lectures are often useless because instead of actually explaining how to solve problems, the whole lecture is wasted on proving random theorems that we will never be expected to prove. If you do bad on the midterm, don't give up as the content gets much better next term which means it is still possible for you to recover your mark. As far as I saw, the first part of the course is tough to wrap your head around for most people but the post midterm content is more computational and easier to understand. If you can take the course online then do it since assignments and quizzes are weighted higher and the exams are online as well.",The first half of the course was super easy and then the course took a turn for the worst. The quizzes are pretty easy but the assignments can be extremely tough - so I suggest that you do not start them at the last minute.,"Can't really speak to its usefulness, but it is a tough course for most people. It's very different from what we've been learning so far so make sure you attend lectures and do the assignments. Do not procrastinate on the assignments as you will regret this when midterms or finals come around. Practice using the theorems and practice the different proofs. Midterm and final are quite reasonable if you put in the work during the term. Final has a couple computation questions which are your easy marks so make sure you get those!","This course wasn't actually that bad but I still didn't like it. It was 1 module and quiz a week which was really easy at the beginning and end of the course. Some parts in the middle of the course made no sense and the questions made even less sense. The basics of supply & demand, elasticity, and types of markets are the only useful takeaways from the course. A lot of the course is common sense and I regret actually taking this course. The discussion posts were easy and the quizzes & exams were medium difficulty.","As someone who did a lot of math contests in high school, I found the course very exciting, and provided me with a new perspective and appreciation for language and proofs in mathematics."
Take CS 135 or 145 if you have prior programming experience. The majority of this course is exceedingly easy if you already know programming basics. It may only possibly get difficult at the very end. The design recipe and templates are the hardest thing for the majority of the course.,the course is hard but definitely manageable. don't stress over the assignments because they are worth so little. rather you should try to understand the content on a much deeper level. that goes a long way,"Learning how to do proofs...well, this course wasn't very interesting especially if you are not of the math type. Assignments are difficult. Midterm was easy and final was easy-fair though.",Hardest Class in 1A! Study until your hand hurts from those proofs. Also post midterm is much easier than pre-midterm.,"Never taken anything even remotely related and this was super easy. Read the modules, take a couple hours each week to do assignments, easy enough midterm and final.","It gives you a first insight of mathematical proofs;a very easy course,but the knowledge taught will be repeatedly used in upper-year math."
Pretty easy straight forward introductory CS course. People complain but scheme syntax but personally I don't mind prefix notation at all.,"I found the course hard since it's not like anything we learned in high school. There were a lot of proofs and algorithms, which I'm not good at. However, the course is very interesting and I enjoyed it.",Very interesting course. Demands a lot but teaches a lot as well,Really interesting course. I was lost in class but it was much better when I self studied. NOT AS HARD as people say it is.,"Actual content is kind of interesting but the course is easy, just read from the textbook",I read somewhere that this course basically teaches you how to math. I second that.
"I have never coded before so i opted to take this rather than CS135. This was really easy for me. I'm glad I took it though becuase it saved time so I can focus more on actual courses for my major (MATH145, PHYS121 etc). Don't expect to be able to code anything after this, especial since you use dr Raket. And the design recipes are a pain, my tip is put 20 test cases for everything.","Was my favourite course in 1A, taught you a different way of thinking and approaching problems. It is a difficult course, but if you read the textbook and do lots and lots of practice problems you will be fine.","Very interesting course, material can be challenging but that is part of why I liked it.","Easy introduction to mathematical thinking and proofs. Assignments were somewhat difficult and long but not worth very much, and were definitely good practice. Midterm was extremely easy and final was quite a bit trickier. Study the later content, and congruences and gcd, really well for the final. Also do the posted practice problems. It can also help to have a good prof in this course and/or read the textbook and most importantly, lots of practice with proofs every week.","Super easy if you do it online, there was no midterm and the final was going to be all multiple choice (except it was cancelled due to the pandemic). There was one multiple choice quiz every week. A lot of the content was just common sense, which makes this a good course to do online because going to lectures would be pretty useless.",A very interesting class that teaches you the fundamentals of proofs and abstract algebra. Essential for anybody who wants to have a basic understanding of how math works. This ain't your high school math anymore.
"A nice intro to coding, especially for those who probably won't take more in upper years; it's good to know the basics.","It's kind of hard for students who are in 1A term because it takes time to get used to this course. The assignments are always much harder than the content, which needs to be improved.",Very hard course. Got bumped up to a 60 after failing the exam and got fucked over in math 136. I however would not do this course again and would not wish this course upon my greatest enemy. It is hell.,Good course. Exams are much easier than the assignments. It feels very rewarding when you figure out proofs.,Pretty interesting course. Got a bit dry towards the end and that made learning the material much harder as it was so boring.,"Very fun class with interesting, albeit not very applicable material. Covers stuff like elementary number theory and touches briefly on fields. Gives an intro to writing proofs by reading proofs, very well taught course. Only regret is not taking the advanced."
great intro course for students with no background experience in CS and who don't plan on pursuing CS in the future. It can be prof dependent though.,Realized how good this course was after the term I finished it. Go through the material thoroughly and the most important part in the course is understanding the definitions and solve as many problems as you can.,Quite an interesting course.,hard but study then not hard but might still be hard,"It's the worst course ever, online especially. They are least interested to teach. They just provided the content to read by ourselves. I wouldn't suggest anyone to take this course online.","I have never thought of or seen math like this before in high school. Being introduced to this course has definitely expanded my horizons on how I see mathematics being applied in the world. It is a challenging course and some concepts are hard to wrap your mind around, however, with practice, it is a doable course. The structure is great and the course is well maintained by the faculty."
The programming language (Scheme/Dr.Racket) wasn't a very good program to use but the concepts behind it are the same I guess ...,"The course was relatively easy, but the midterm was setup poorly - the focus was not on core concepts but on the exactness of the stepping problems, which I don't think is useful at all.",This course was my favorite in first year. It's really fun. I enjoyed writing codes a lot.,Honestly I struggled with the course more than I should have in hindsight. But don't despair if you get a bad midterm mark - if you work hard you can improve your mark in the final.,"Took this course online. Your mark essentially consists of a series of 10 question multiple choice quizzes weekly, 2 discussions, and 2 fully multiple-choice exams. Definitely was not a ""hard"" course, but I definitely do not think this course was as easy as many made it seem. You will need to put in at least a fair bit of effort, time, and devotion into this course in order to ensure a good mark.",Should be a breeze and quite fun if you love competition math and proofs. Loved the number theory the most.
They teach Dr Racket in this course. No one ever uses Dr Racket. This is waste of time but can't skip it either.,Pretty challenging course for someone coming out of a standard high school curriculum. Bunch of theorems that you need to know when and where to apply. Logical thinking this course taught is useful throughout your undergrad degree,Hardest course I've taken yet. Manageable with ample studying and practicing though.,Fascinating course that ramped up in difficulty after midterms.,Easiest course I've ever taken. No need to go to class or get the textbook. If you just read the slides the night before the midterms and exam you should be able to get a high 90. It's 100% multiple choice and mostly common sense.,"Omg, one bitch of a course. But it got interesting later on. It shows you how to formalize your proofs and give you a better understanding of proof techniques used later on."
"It's pretty much an introduction to computer science concepts like recursion,BSTs and other abstract data types. It's VERY useful if you have no prior experience with programming.","I honestly didn't find this course too bad. Writing proofs seems daunting at first, but with practice, you'll start to be able to think in that manner and it will become much easier. I would caution relying on others for help too much though- I think the best way to screw yourself over in this course is to not keep pushing even when you get stuck on a question (Which happens a lot).","Personally I thought the course was really easy-- at first. But don't let yourself slack off, because otherwise you will find yourself easily confused and lost as you fall further behind. Material gets harder as course moves along. Course material is still very relevant in other courses and in the future.",I had no programming experience before this class and it still wasn't too hard for the most part. A good elective. Some assignments were tricky but the exams were easy.,"useless course, took it as an elective and i needed to work hard, not a bird course for me, never took business inn highschool and also didnt bother to buy the textbook, which couldve helped. lectures everyone were on their phones or playing games on their laptops.","Very insightful course. Great if you love number theory. Has more applications in pure math than in other areas, but useful nonetheless for proofs."
"Joke course if you're a CS major who is taking it just to get a good CAV (to transfer from regular to co-op, that is).","Reviewing as a science major, this course was definitely the one that set me up with programming. Even though it was Dr. Racket, concepts were easy to follow. Be sure to go ask a lot of questions if you do not understand.","I actually enjoyed this course. It was a lot of new stuff for me but nothing too hard to get. Assignments were impossible to do alone so I had to go to office hours every week or talk with friends or go to tutorial centre to solve everything. The textbook is pretty useful, has some good examples.","Not an ""EASY"" course at all. Anyone commentating that is probably a Math/Eng student who is already familiar with coding through other courses. Since the midterm/exam is on paper, you have to be able to imagine what your code is going to be able to do without actually testing it like you do in your assignments! Speaking of assignment, they're bloody hard! No joke, it might take you an entire day to problem solve your way through them and that might not even be enough - incredibly frustrating course and not recommended unless you really want to study coding in the future. DR. Racket is not even applicable to most organizations. If you want to learn coding, just pick up something off Amazon or get a pdf through a friend - don't spend money here unless you're actually planning on continuing studies in CS.",Easy course if you NEVER took econ before.. probably extremely boring if you have taken econ before. All exams are multiple choice,"This course teaches a completely new concept for most, proofs. Once you understand how to build a proof, the course gets easier, however some students never figure that part out. I think the pacing of the course is really well. My biggest piece of advice is to do the assignments by yourself. Struggling through and failing is how you learn. This is what will allow you to figure out exactly what theorems and techniques to use when which is the key to doing well overall. I personally really enjoyed proofs by the end of the course as it is a refreshing way to look at mathematics and if you truly love math you will love this course. That being said, the course is very professor dependent, so different professors provide very different experiences in this course."
"you gotta at least pay attention in class, or do homework","BE WARNED! This course is VERY challenging for those who are starting to do proofs. A lot of things get thrown at you very quickly, and it is hard to keep track of everything. Assignments took VERY long each week. Definitely NOT an easy course.","Fairly easy course overall, enjoyed the class a lot. Carrie Knoll was an excellent lecturer.","As a CS student, I didn't really enjoy this ""real math"" stuff. I crammed for the final the day before, and was able to get a good mark. The material seems confusing at first, but if you keep up you should be set. Midterm and final are easier than assignments. Would recommend going over every major sections after you are done with them (ie. securing commerce, proof techniques, polynomials etc.)","As a math students, much of my time was wasted in this course. We had lectures on basic knowledge such as how to calculate the slope of a line and how to read a graph. A waste of my time. Should have taken my transfer credit from AP.","Standard introduction to the common proof techniques. Depending on your background in Math, you may find this course very easy or very hard."
i hate racket,"This course really expands my thinking as a mathematician. It starts easy and gradually builds up the level of difficulty. Some assignment questions near the end of the course really take time, but also intriguing. I could spend a day just to finish an assignment without being bored. Overall, this is my favorite course in 1A and I did learn a lot of fun stuff.","By far the most interesting course of 1A. Teaching proof techniques is the main focus of the course, and is done quite well -- but all the topics that we touched on (gcd, complex numbers, modular arithmetic), were interesting too! One assignment a week, which usually took 3-6 hours, plus three Mobius quizzes a week, open for 24 hours each. The midterm was challenging but still fair, and the final was much easier. My only regret is not taking MATH 145 instead. If you are anywhere near the Euclid score cutoff, you should apply for the advanced courses instead -- you will likely find 135 to be fairly easy.","If there's one class you don't want to fall behind in, it's this one. Each new concept builds onto the previous one. If you're like me and don't have much experience with number theory or really any math outside of high school math courses (which you did well in), this will not be an easy course. A lot of the math is new and abstract. Make sure to do as much practice as you can to familiarize with all the theorems (there are a LOT of theorems). The final exam is worth 60% so even if you do well on the weekly assignments and midterm, you still have to study hard.","where do I even start, horrible prof, horrible class, made no effort to teach, everything was taught through reading the textbook, the class was made up of weekly quizzes, a midterm, and exam, which were all BS. The only reason I did good was that I took Econ in high school lol.","Get the course notes and read through them if you're having any difficulty with any topics. Could probably just learn the whole course from the course notes, but lectures are still useful for examples and different methods. Lots of new stuff from high school, proofs scared the living daylights out of most before we got used to them, but it became easier with a bit of practice. Just a matter of getting used to the creative way of thinking. Very interesting course if you want to understand some number theory"
Please be very careful about the design recipe (especially tests and examples),"Proofs! The harder problem solving works out to be either you know it or you don't know it, so you basically just have to do a lot of problem solving and maybe something will stick. This course is good for writing proofs in other courses later.",Amazing course! you'll either love it or hate it lol. Need to go to lectures and keep up with the assignments to do well. Textbook is very useful! Choose your prof wisely as that will impact your grade significantly.,"Assignment is much more difficult than the test, follow the lecture and do the assignment then you will do well in this course. However, be very careful after Midterm because there are so many theorem that you need to memorize or you will find yourself fall further behind.","I recommend finding a course with a language that is actually useful. Racket is dumb and never used anywhere. The majority of the course was quite easy, except a couple of concept checks that were RIDICULOUSLY HARD. i wish i had realized sooner that you get 10% of concept checks dropped from your grade. if you understand everything and are getting most things easily but you get stumped on one particular concept check, its probably not your fault and you should skip it, at least for now. the course was very well structured and predictable. expectations were clear and reasonable. it actually was designed to be a correspondence course, so it wasnt an online course that was rushed and slapped together for covid.",This course requires a complete shift in the mathematical thinking that you have done in high school so expect to spend a bit of time to get it right and understand how to solve the questions. Otherwise memorize all the theorems and definitions and you will be fine.
fuck i hate design recipe. your lose marks for nothing!,Assignments were generally easy. Do the practice problems throughout the term and go to res tutoring or the tutorial centre if you need help with a question. You need a 60% in the course to pass.,"Great course with emphasis on proofs covering many topics. Some of the proofs can be pretty challenging to figure out, but are rewarding upon completion. Start your assignments early and don't be afraid to ask friends or your prof for clues to assignment problems if you are stuck.","It's hard to motivate yourself to do the assignments when each is 2% or something, but it really is important to keep on top of it. They only get harder and arguably the only way to guarantee that you'll do well on the midterm (since you WILL be asked to write mini programs) I personally found the exam to be much harder than the midterm, so you really need to use the midterm as a grade booster.","Jokes class. Took it with a prof who does nothing from the textbook and I swear he made up the whole course. Midterms and final are an easy 90, if not 110","Learned a lot on how to properly write proofs and different mathematical ways of thinking. If you were even a bit serious about contest maths in high school, this course is an easy 90+. Also, Anton is just absolutely goated -- if you have the chance, join in on one of his lectures or even just read his lecture notes!"
,I wouldn't say it was an easy course but it is definitely manageable. Midterm was not easy but finals was quite light. Definitely the course I enjoyed the most as I learned a lot.,Pretty interesting course. Mobius quizzes were quite easy but set aside a fair amount of time for written assignments as they tend to get much more difficult post midterm.,"Difficulty is like a bell-curve. Starts easy, then hard, then easy. Do your assignments.","No assignments no quiz, just two midterms and a final for my section. Boring but quite easy.",In my opinion one of the best run courses. Does a great job of introducing a new perspective on math.
,"this is a really great and interesting course! There is a lot of learning to do, and you do need a very consistent work ethic in order to keep up with course content. Practice makes perfect!","A great course, but a little strange if you're used to object oriented programming.",Study hard for Math 135,"PROS: (1) Readings itself were simple to understand. (2) Nicely arranged content on Learn and Mobius (I took it online). (3) Decent grade, task, and submission period distribution. CONS: (1) Too many readings for a first-time learner of econ. (2) One collective zoom office hour (1 hour long) at the beginning of the week felt very unfair (3) Found a need for more OHs each week and a MS teams GC. (4) Felt isolated from the rest of the class. (5) lack of one-to-one instructional support (unless you email every question). (6) Had to refer to external resources for quicker understanding because readings were too time consuming. (7) Weren't taught at all on how to approach an article/case study. TIPS: (1) Finish all readings in the first two days of the week, (2) repeat quizzes till you get them correct (you get 4 chances per graded quiz every week, please use these well). (3) Don’t just read to study, answer a lot of MCQs.","Difficult course coming out of high school. The computational stuff wasn't bad (just involved practice) but, as others have said, proofs were the tough. I think the whole idea is to transition your mind from just computational/plug and play mathematics (the only kind you get exposed to in high school) to more creative thinking based mathematics."
,"Definitely a challenging course, especially if you have no prior experience with writing formal proofs. Just make sure that you practice the concepts by finding question banks online and you'll be fine!",First half of the course was on proof techniques. The material covered was for the most part easy albeit a bit bland. Midterm was fairly straightforward as was the final exam.,"taught terribly, seems so unorganized and the actual midterm/exam questions are different to the ones you use on pearson.","im lucky i passed this course, i would never want to this ever again....","Pretty easy proofs course coming from a non-proof heavy background. Just do the weekly assignments and understand them (i.e. don't just get the answers from someone else, do them yourself), and lots of practice outside of that."
,"Really good course, make sure you do a lot of practice. But watch out, you're professor can dramatically impact your experience in this course.",Do your assignments with a buddy. Was a bit difficult near the end but very rewarding course.,"It's easy if you know how to study properly (did not do this until the final, so didnt do too great). Just STUDY FROM and MEMORIZE the practice questions/exam bank. Seriously a lot of the questions on the final are suuuper similar and sometimes even word for word exact numbers. So basically, you arent supposed to try and actually learn the content, just memorize. Really dumb since people dont retain the knowledge but easy mark if you just memorize the exam bank.","Avoid the online course but, it has a nice bell curve",A course on proofs. It surveys topics in number theory to provide examples of theorems and their proofs. The content on things like modular arithmetic and complex numbers is less useful than the practice students get writing proofs.
,"This is most definitely the hardest course I had in 1A. I guess I'm not really a proofs person. I would definitely recommend going to tutoring in residence - it's very useful for completing assignments and generally understanding some of the material. If you don't understand what the prof is talking about in class, make sure you clarify with them. Get help when you need it before it's too late.","Can be difficult at times, but a very rewarding and fun course. Definitely made me like CS as a non-CS student! Start assignments early and definitely go to office hours. TAs and ISAs are very helpful.","Very easy till the midterm. After that, they go Super Saiyan mode and give hard af assignments. Very interesting tho. The profs are working hard on the online version.","Took this course online by Prof Wendy Roth, easy course, but felt 102 is easier than 101.",Great introduction to math@UW! LOVED this course.
,"Learning proofs was useful in the first half of the course, after that it was all useless bs. Assignments were all about finding little tricks, not actually testing the content.","This course feels more like a logic course. It covered a lot of topics, but the concept is very fun to learn(depending on your prof). The first part of the class was fairly intuitive. The second part gets more complicated, but it was still interesting overall.","A solid, and worthwhile course to teach you the fundamentals of mathematical proofs. The hard work is definitely worth it!",Boring course,Proofs are a pretty big shift from high school math
,"This course was personally very easy for me and I enjoyed it very much. You learn the foundation of theory, proofs, elementary number theory and crypto. Really try to learn from this course; the assignments are tough and the exam was half the difficulty of the assignments (which is good).","I really enjoyed this class! It was quite difficult, but I learned a lot!","Easy course if you study, Hard course if you're too lazy to put in the time.",Wasted my elective on this when I could have taken much better courses.,You gotta get used to proofs if you're a math student.
,"Don’t be mistaken, this course is tough. It will teach you pretty much the foundations of UW mathematics. You need to listen and spend a lot of time just thinking about the problems. Take some time with the course and you’ll enjoy it a lot.","fun stuff, felt really amazing grasping the content by the end. do the assignments on your own, go to all the lectures, and do the randomized practice. you should be fine.","This course does not test one's ability to study. This course tests once's ability to think. As such, to do well in the course, you'd better just be a naturally smart person, or else you are going to have to slog away at practice problems for dayss",Very dry and boring. All MC questions. Everything from the textbook. They try to trick you in some questions.,"The first part is useful, it shows me some justifications on what is different from what I learned in high school (something like 0^0=1). The second part is annoying, since I didn't learn number theory in high school, so it's hard for me to cope with difficult questions. When it goes to Prime Number, there are questions I have no idea to get full marks (question itself is easy to answer, but no idea how to avoid losing partial marks, fortunately, TAs are willing to give full marks) The third part RSA (application on number theory) is really interesting. Overall, easy course with a high grade because there are 2 free bonus marks. The final exam is hard. Some questions you have no idea how to get full marks even if you know how to solve them. If you have done many proofs in high school, easy 90+ as an online course. Just using Excel to make a calculator. EEA helps a lot."
,It is a useful course but definitely not easy if you never prove before.,"I feel like it's too early in my academic career to speak of the usefulness of this course. I will agree with what others have said, pre-midterm this class is really not tough. In fact my advice would be to squeeze all the marks you can pre-midterm, by doing this you are able to save your dropped assignment for the second half when assignments become a lot harder and you can go into the exam being able to pass the course with a fail on the exam. Also go to office hours and start assignments early, they're a great help.","At first was hard to grasp how to write good proofs, but by the midterm and further on it was easier.",Note: The curriculum has changed since I took this course.,Basic math knowledge.
,Easy final. Pay attention and do the assignments--that should more than prepare you for the course.,"Fun, but the topics get too abstract nearing the end. The first half of the course was much more enjoyable and useful imo","Basic econ stuff. If you took econ in high school, it'll be pretty easy. Otherwise you might have some trouble, but it's still decently basic stuff, and concepts that can be explained by YouTube videos. The majority of the midterm and final questions (all MC) are from test banks if you can get those. Entire mark composed of two midterms and a final.",Introductory course to microeconomics. Not hard at all if you read the textbook and make notes. I only spent two days studying before the midterm and the final and ended up with 80+.,the basic of math
,"Really interesting course, makes you explore a whole new way of understanding mathematics. Unfortunately, if you're in-person only 20% of your grade is from assignments and quizzes, and the other 80 is midterm and final. Makes it really demotivating at times because each assignment is only 1% of your grade.","Took this in person F2020, it truly opened my eyes to the world of real mathematics. Well-organized course with quite a few amazing prof. I had Faisal, really enjoyed his lectures and he was active on Piazza as well. The first half of the class teaches you proof techniques and some basic mathematical logic (which you will see again in CS 245), then second half goes into elementary number theory stuff (prime numbers, division theorem, modulo) and complex numbers. The weekly assignments were tough and I always do them 2 or 3 days before deadline so it was not a nice experience at all so my tip is to start them asap and get help from instructor or TA whenever you get dead stuck. I regret not going to office hours and had to suffer hard.","Just read the textbook and slides, actual lectures seems to be pretty useless",Easy bird course. Multiple choice ftw.,"If you do poorly in this course, you're probably not cut out for ""real"" math."
,"When I say easy, take it in moderation. To many people, this will be the hardest 1A course you have.",Was a good course. Very interesting and stuff.,"Came in with no prior knowledge, skipped every lecture, studied 4h per exam, ended with low 90s.","Took it as a bird course. Sure, it was birdy, but it was really boring.",Great introduction to proofs.
,Pretty easy course overall! I stopped going to labs about three weeks in and still managed to get the bonus 3%. The assignments were relatively easy (with one or two exceptions).,"Pretty difficult course, but very useful for future years.",Birdiest course I've ever taken. Don't even need to go to lectures just study from the textbook and solve the exam bank questions. The version of the textbook doesn't matter so don't waste money on a newer version.,"Read the text book, do those multiple choice questions from the study guide then you will be all set.","""Intro to math"""
,"The course was like an edible that's too strong. At first everything is great and you think it's soft but you just keep coming up. As it progresses, the intensity only increases and can become overwhelming and you may not like it. If you don't like your prof I would recommend skipping your lectures and using the mobius lessons. They are much more concise and you can be sure that you will not miss something covered on the assignments. Also the feedback part can be very similar to the quizzes. Overall it was very rewarding to finish the course, but just beware that it becomes more time consuming towards the end.",Useful and relevant course. Well structured and interesting.,"Really easy course. Only 3 exams, two midterms and a final throughout the whole course. Only went to a couple of classes and still passed decently.","I think this course ran well online, the notes were very organized and easy enough to follow along and there is good support from most of the proffs and tas. The course may be a little fast for a complete cs beginner but the course has 400+ practice questions to help prepare for the weekly assignments","A large variety of mathematical theorems, but most importantly proofs."
,"As someone who was nervous about proofs going into the course, I found that this course introduced them well! While I struggled with some of the concepts, I found proving things to be fun and sometimes even satisfying.",tough course. hardest course for my first term,"It is important to go to the lectures, because that is the determinant factor of your grade and how good you will understand the course content.","Olivia Mesta was a great professor, made the material extremely clear and easy to understand. Weekly quizzes on Aplia were time consuming but helped you understand the material better. Multiple choice exams were very easy.","I can see the course being useful for other students, however I don't see the application to my daily life personally. I disliked this course strongly, due to my struggle with math and economic concepts, and was unfortunately required to take this course. Would not have taken it otherwise."
,"This course is an introduction to proofs. I remember it being very difficult to grasp some concepts, and I spent a long time on assignments. But what you learn in this course is quite important for upper years. I took it in Fall 2020, online.",Good course for my first CS course.,Must attend lectures if you're new to programming.,"As a science student with no background knowledge of business/economics, its not too easy. Yes the concepts are easy but if you dont read the textbook and actually put in effort you wont do better than high 70s.","Could've just been the lecturer (Allison Mascella) I had, and found it hard to understand topics (since she didn't offer much clarification). You can understand topics in the real world context and therefor found it useful"
,"Essential course, taught me to think differently than before I took it.","Awesome course, isn't too difficult like CS 135, but actually teaches you some good things. If you're looking for a not too difficult CS course, this is it right here. Make sure to leave a few hours aside to get through the assignments, they can be a bit tricky. Easy exams.",useless but easy to get a good grade,"Similar to the review before me, I took the online version. There are zero synchronous lectures, so be prepared to spend circa 3-5 hours every week trying to memorize the course content which is presented on UW Mobius. Another peculiarity of this course is the lack of any useful practice problems. The concept checks on UW Mobius are very elementary, and they are not a representation of what you will be evaluated on during the midterm and final exam. Although this course features weekly quizzes, you only have access to your grade after completing them. As a result, you will not be able to re-visit the weekly quizzes before the assessments to learn from your mistakes.",A lot of Math that you probably didn't see in high school.
,It is definitely one of the most interesting courses in my first year as it is the course that has the most new content compared to the other courses. The course was certainly challenging though I'd give it that but I did learn a lot from it. The most important thing about the course I'd say is PRACTICE!,"The course was organized well this online term and most of the material serves as a good foundation for future math courses. The assignments got quite difficult and tedious towards the end, which was incredibly frustrating. If you put in the effort and go the extra mile to do things like attend office hours and do practice problems, you'll be in good shape grade-wise.","The averages for the midterms were in the low 70s (harder to get a higher mark because there were only 27 scantron Q's every midterm). Concepts were easy to understand - application is the harder part. Aplia isn't useful, but she did post another link to practice questions before the exam and that really helped me. You'd be OK just studying from the powerpoints. Textbook is only if you want a better grasp of concepts.",Learn nothing but gain a super high mark. Good course for those who want to switch programs or apply coop. Everything is common sense so nothing needs to memory.,"Wrap your head around all the different models used, and you'll do fine. If you like math, this is especially a breeze."
,"I found this course to be very challenging. might have been because I did not like my profs teaching style. proofs were nothing I have done or seen before so math135 was very new to me. the textbook isn't very useful to learn how to come up with proofs that were on any of the assessments. the weekly assignments were extremely difficult and took the average student around 5-10 hours a week to complete. weekly quizzes were good to assess textbook understanding. as someone who struggled in this course, i have to say the responses on piaaza were essentially useless when i asked questions about the course content, their response everything was a direct quotation from the textbook, or if they were feeling extra lazy would just say 'look at the course notes'.","The end of the course became quite tough but otherwise this was pretty manageable. Excellent professors and ISA's who always take our feedback and concerns into consideration to make the course experience better, including having office hours very late at night and very early in the morning. The online platform is also excellent and fun to use.","Honestly, just show up and make some flashcards. It's not hard at all. If you study, show up, and try to get a good grade it's easy to get above an 85.","Do the assignments and practice problems and you should be good on the course! The course notes are really useful so read them regularly. Lectures aren't the most useful, but they do give tips on how to use formulas and theorems.","Easy course, understand all the proof and theories and you will get high mark in this course easily"
,"The course forces you to really understand proof techniques, and how exactly to prove things. This idea of proving things becomes very important in the future, so it is appropriate for students to take Math 135 as an early course. Proof-type questions can either take forever because you don't know how to approach the problem or have logically consistent arguments, or they can be done very quickly if you see what exactly you need to do and you are confident with your answer. Personally, I liked the proofs portion of the course more than the computation concepts later on since the elegance and conciseness of proofs are more appealing than repetitive computations. Overall, the course does a great job of getting you into the feel of University; it could make or break you quite easily.","Probably the hardest first year course, a course solely on how to prove things. It is invaluable if you are pursuing a cs degree however.","Very easy course and the material was interesting enough. Dry at some points but it's just memorization for those bits. You don't need to go to lectures, you can just read the textbook and do study guide questions. Was an easy 95+.","Fair difficulty but very tedious/annoying proofs on weekly written assignments (15-22h each week for me, to achieve low 90s on average) that just made me not want to see a proof ever again. Mike Cooper-Stachowsky is an amazing lecturer, but even then, I couldn't find myself engaged in the content apart from the concept (not proofs - those were not engaging) of modular arithmetic and RSA encryption. The Mobius assignments (quizzes) were free marks if you put enough time/effort into them since they had 3 attempts each, and oftentimes there were some questions that just took away so much of my sanity that I gave up and settled for a lower grade.",A lot of intuition with proofs is required.
,"This course is taught in an archaic language that no one uses and no one understands. Instructors' explanations are irrelevant to actual questions and I got yelled during office hrs even though I stated that I need a little patience (I am disabled). Assignments and quizzes are unreasonably hard. I took to take this for bioinformatics option and decided to change my future career. Truly the worst in UW history. If you don't need this course, run.",Probably my favourite course in 1A. Easy to do well in the course and the staff put the learning materials together really well. Really enjoyed this course since it teaches you about the art of problem-solving and the creative components of mathematics. If you stay on top of the material and start the psets early enough you'll do well.,"Not very useful as an elective, but I suppose it gives a better understanding of how markets work. It was very easy - I just had to read lecture slides. The midterms and final exam are all multiple choice.","I took this asynchronous so I can't say necessarily the same is true for in-person, but the course was overall really dry. As a disclaimer I never took econ before in high school. The course content had nonexistent explanations, motivation, applications, citations or justifications. It reminded me of memorisation-heavy high school courses that feed you information, never explaining why they are true or why you would ever need to know them. Some reviews below claim that most statements are common sense, but as someone who has never taken econ in high school, I find that there are several unjustified claims in the modules, such as ""why is ATC minimized when MC=AVC?"" I later found a proof of this using calculus, but nonetheless there is zero reason to expect this to be true using ""common sense"", nor was there any reasoning of this in the module. There were a lot of erroneous questions (like two MCQ choices are the same) on the quizzes, midterms and final, and you don't get the answers after each quiz, so overall the quality of the presentation and assessments were likewise nonexistent. They claim they hide the answers for copyright reasons but 90% of the questions can be found on quizlet. The textbook was completely unnecessary. Further, the prof's presence was nonexistent. First asynchronous course though, so I'm not sure if all asynchronous courses are as garbage as this one.","Interesting course because problem-solving is interesting. However, sometimes it gets boring (i.e. prime number stuff, modular artihmetic) because you know that you'll never apply this knowledge in real life (at least for me personally). Assignments are really annoying because sometimes they allow for basic hand-waving and other times they arbitrarily demand absolute rigour. As a result, you have to constantly browse Piazza to see what you can hand-wave and what you can't."
,One of my favorite courses of all time. It's a breather from other courses since it really tests your logic and problem-solving skills. Each question feels like a fun puzzle.,"Assignments are difficult, tests are easy, extremely useful","I only went to 3 lectures the entire semester. Works well if you only get multiple choice exams. It's neoclassical microeconomics, so it can only get so useful since no one is the perfect, rational human being.","Took online, almost all multiple choice, a lot of questions are common sense",No help or explanations in online course just give quiz let answers
,"A difficult course coming from high school. The proof techniques are definitely useful to know if you're heading into Pure Math or something, but less relevant to a CS major. Nice to know, still. Makes me feel smarter.","Racket sucks, but the content of the course was easy enough to digest if you never did programming before. Seek help if you need it (early) and don't be afraid to talk to the TAs and profs!","Took it as a CSE, highest graded CSE course I have on record. Multiple choice midterm and final exams. Skipped couple lectures, but studying only the optional assignments and practice exams guaranteed a 100%",Boring but easy.,proof based math is a new way of thinking.
,"Arguably the hardest course in 1A for any first year in the faculty of mathematics. You really have to put the work in to understand the concepts which are not exactly easy to grasp. Assignments take many hours, midterm was fairly easy and final was fair. Good luck to anyone taking this course, just remember not to panic, you will be fine, everyone goes through the same stage and eventually we all survive.","I found this course to be quite difficult, but my profs, Yu Ru Liu and Wentang Kuo, made it bearable with their office hours; 10/10 will take any course with either of them again!",Sometimes it got confusing because of the graphs on the final but easy course if you put in the work.,You don't get the results of your quizzes which is sooo stupid. How should we understand where we went wrong if you don't tell us? I hated the quizzes but the discussions were easy marks if you post enough.,This course is totally a easy course in university.
,Don't get too lost and give up at the beginning of the course. It gets easier and just do tons of practise questions.,"Tough class, especially coming right from high school. The material is really cool, though, and the class is hugely important for all future math classes you'd take. (This is based on the Fall 2009 offering; it's changed a bit since then)",Have work for your grade.,So boring,UGH :( the horrors of this course will haunt me for the rest of my university life
,"Was fun at first as it's similar to competitive math, but as the term goes on and assignments pile, it's not that great. Assignments are based somewhat on the material but it will take a long time just to finish one question.",Pretty cool course. They teach you a bunch of number theory and a lot of it is very interesting.,You don't even have to come to lectures.,A whole lot of proofs. It is not likely that you will ever use more than 10% of the course content ever again.,"Kinda fun around all kinds of prepositions, theorems, lemmas etc. A lot of materials after the midterm."
,"The concepts are easy, but the applications are difficult. The problems on assignments and exams are fun, but challenging (and very rewarding when you finally get it right).","Got a 60 by taking a shit on the tests, by far the most useless course in my undergrad. The ONLY things that I use are the proof techniques. All the theorems are complete garbage.",Just do more practice,"Read the textbook, it is a godsend",loved this course
,"Was a nice way to learn recursion, which is essentially the purpose of this course. They also give a lot of free marks with a 3% lab bonus - DO THEM! That 3% can make a big difference in your mark.","Taken Online: I took this course because at one point I wanted to be a business student, this course taught me that it wasn't really for me in the end. Great bird course, really only skimmed notes before quizzes and crammed before finals and midterms. I wish I paid more attention so I could take 102 for the 3 prerequisite chain.",Too much memorization,Two words: WOKIA KUMASE,Easiest CS course this university has to offer. Basic math and you're good to go.
,"Not easy, but what I will say is that I loved just about every concept we covered. It was truly interesting, challenging (but not challenging to the point where I felt I couldn't do it). Really just one of my favourite courses I've ever taken.",Easy course (if you get the right prof).,Great introduction to Mathematics at the University of Waterloo. Fun course but can be difficult at times. Keep up with the readings and study/practice hard and you should do fine.,,Welcome to Waterloo Math.
,"The material is quite different from any math I have seen before, but it is generally straightforward. Some of the assignment questions were hard.",This course kills a part of me. It is quite possibly the driest course I have taken at Waterloo so far. The hardest part of this course is trying to muster the motivation to learn about the stupidest concepts ever.,"MEh, wasn't too hard. Really boring in my opinion.",,
,"Amazing and challenging course overall. It's totally worth the hassle to override into this course even if you're not in the math faculty. The assignments are brutal to complete as they require so much time to figure out. But I would advise everyone to do them all on their own as they're there for you to develop the thinking you need to succeed. Anyone can understand a solution, but coming up with it is the hard part. It may be very difficult to do this in-between 5 other courses (3 of which are even tougher than Math 135), but it is possible. Good time management skills can lead to you finding more time to work on assignments such as the 10 minutes in-between lectures. The solutions will often feel like it comes down to a lucky guess. In general, the professors are pretty amazing. The math faculty doesn't send random people with thick accents to teach all their first year courses. Even if you do fail, there's still 10 more sections in the winter term where they mark easier, and 2 more sections in the spring where exams get easier. This course makes you a way better thinker when it comes to solving problems, and you'll gain way more out of it than most courses. This course can be an amazing experience to anybody.",i had conrad hewitt. i didn't learn anything in class because he went so fast. honestly the notes for this course are really well made. i just went to the tutorial centre at mkv to finish off all the assignments with a LOT of help. pulled a decent mark somehow tho,"Good introduction to proofs, which comes in handy for every other math course. Course is structured really well so assignments are very hard but very rewarding once you finally get it. Anton Mosunov is the GOAT",,
