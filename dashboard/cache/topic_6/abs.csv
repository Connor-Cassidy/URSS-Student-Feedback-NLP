"Took this in 2018 with no programming experience ever. Went to a lot of office hours, but nonetheless caught up and did decently well. Racket was such an annoying language to use.",math student who took this course since I had 0 prior programming experience. The racket language used in this course is easy to follow but not very useful and isn't used anywhere. Racket is somewhat useless but I learned some concepts that will be useful for other programming languages.,Really easy course. Especially if you have coded before. Assignments get a little harder at the end but both the midterm and finals were easy. The only thing I hated about this course was how annoying using Dr. Racket can be at times. i hate racket fuck i hate design recipe. your lose marks for nothing!
This course really expands my thinking as a mathematician. It starts easy and gradually builds up the level of difficulty. Be sure to go ask a lot of questions if you do not understand. Assignments were generally easy.,So Easy. Just follow the course notes. It literally tells you how to do everything you need to do. This course really expands my thinking as a mathematician. Midterm was not easy but finals was quite light.,"Was my favourite course in 1A, taught you a different way of thinking and approaching problems. The midterm was setup poorly - the focus was not on core concepts but on the exactness of the stepping problems, which I don't think is useful at all."
"Interesting material, but truly quite difficult. Takes a lot of practice, especially before major assessments. Do your assignments with a buddy. Midterm and Final were straightforward.","Interesting material, but truly quite difficult. Takes a lot of practice, especially before major assessments. Fairly easy course overall, enjoyed the class a lot.","The hardest part of this course is trying to muster the motivation to learn about the stupidest concepts ever. Got a 60 by taking a shit on the tests, by far the most useless course in my undergrad."
This course is interesting and easy before the midterm. Still interesting after the midterm but it is super hard. I took it twice and still couldn't get a good grade.,"This course is interesting and easy before the midterm. Still interesting after the midterm but it is super hard. If you study, show up, and try to get a good grade it's easy to get above an 85.","taught terribly, seems so unorganized and the actual midterm/exam questions are different to the ones you use on pearson. Came in with no prior knowledge, skipped every lecture, studied 4h per exam, ended with low 90s."
"SO easy, didn't pay attention in the lectures, just used course notes. Reading the textbook was a much bigger help than attending lectures. Do not take this as an elective unless coding/math is easy for you!",Olivia Mesta was a great professor. Reading the textbook was a much bigger help than attending lectures. Weekly quizzes on Aplia were time consuming but helped you understand the material better.,"It's the worst course ever, online especially. They are least interested to teach. They just provided the content to read by ourselves. A waste of my time. Should have taken my transfer credit from AP."
"This course is great for anyone that is interested in math. Pay attention to the lectures as some of the content will show up in upper year math courses. If you do poorly in this course, you're probably not cut out for ""real"" math.","This course is great for anyone that is interested in math. Anton is just absolutely goated -- if you have the chance, join in on one of his lectures or even just read his lecture notes.",UGH :( the horrors of this course will haunt me for the rest of my university life. I will never be able to go back to university again.
