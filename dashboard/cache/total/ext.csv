Really easy course. Especially if you have coded before. Assignments get a little harder at the end but both the midterm and finals were easy. The only thing I hated about this course was how annoying using Dr. Racket can be at times.
Very easy course if you keep up with the material and do the assignments.
This course is interesting and easy before the midterm. Still interesting after the midterm but it is super hard. I took it twice and still couldn't get a good grade
"SO easy, didn't pay attention in the lectures, just used course notes."
"Interesting material, but truly quite difficult. Takes a lot of practice, especially before major assessments, so keeping on top of assignments and quizzes helps a lot."
Useful course. Assignments get a lot harder after the midterm.
"The most disgusting piece of content that I have ever learnt in my life. This course is so useless and unnecessarily complicated. The lectures are often useless because instead of actually explaining how to solve problems, the whole lecture is wasted on proving random theorems that we will never be expected to prove. If you do bad on the midterm, don't give up as the content gets much better next term which means it is still possible for you to recover your mark. As far as I saw, the first part of the course is tough to wrap your head around for most people but the post midterm content is more computational and easier to understand. If you can take the course online then do it since assignments and quizzes are weighted higher and the exams are online as well."
"This course isn't easy. It takes a lot of hard work from your end to get a good mark. As the semester progresses, the concepts get harder. That is, at first, they can sound very confusing and intimidating. However, with a lot of practice and patience, you can relate to the topics more effectively. The proofs come to you with patience. Don't get discouraged if you are not able to solve them right away."
"This course is all about writing proofs. Most of the concepts were super interesting but writing the proofs was challenging. The course is designed really well as each chapter flows into the next, so you really understand the connections. Do the assignments yourself and try to do the extra practice before midterms and finals. I personally loved this course!"
Interesting course. Assignments can be challenging so start those as soon as possible. Midterm and Final were straightforward.
"do not take this as an elective unless coding/math is easy for you! there are a lot of concepts, impossible to teach yourself from the course notes because of how poorly organized they are. lectures are impossibly boring. My best friend tutors this class and I still justtttt scraped by. language is not super useful in life. many of my friends have taken this course because they heard it was easy and ended up failing."
"math student who took this course since I had 0 prior programming experience. the course isn't horribly hard, but if you fall behind or don't understand one lesson, everything following will be super challenging. the course was mostly online completing modules, and my biggest criticism is that solutions for lessons are never posted after they are due which makes it super challenging to do the next week's module if you didn't understand/didnt know how to write a specific code for the week. the racket language used in this course is easy to follow but not very useful and isn't used anywhere. this makes it difficult to find help outside of cs115 profs/ta's/past cs115 students. the course is oddly paced, felt the super easy and simple first half of the course, and then gets unreasonably fast. didn't find any of the profs/ta's answers to questions posted on discussion boards useful at all. because the course was only offered online, I had to essentially had to teach the whole course to myself"
"Very useful course. Really enjoyed applying proof techniques to different questions. Although somewhere around (Assignment 4+), assignment difficulty went from stupidly easy to incredibly difficult and it could take upwards of 15 hours to complete a problem set."
This course teaches proof techniques which I assume that will be used a lot in future math courses and ended with lots of calculation. It was neither hard nor hard but I learned how to manage time wisely (took some time to get used to first-year university math tho).
the course is hard but definitely manageable. don't stress over the assignments because they are worth so little. rather you should try to understand the content on a much deeper level. that goes a long way
"So Easy. Just follow the course notes. It literally tells you how to do everything you need to do. Assignments take some time, so leave a few hours aside for them. Otherwise this class is super easy."
"I found the course hard since it's not like anything we learned in high school. There were a lot of proofs and algorithms, which I'm not good at. However, the course is very interesting and I enjoyed it."
"The course was relatively easy, but the midterm was setup poorly - the focus was not on core concepts but on the exactness of the stepping problems, which I don't think is useful at all."
Really interesting course. I was lost in class but it was much better when I self studied. NOT AS HARD as people say it is.
"Really interesting course, makes you explore a whole new way of understanding mathematics. Unfortunately, if you're in-person only 20% of your grade is from assignments and quizzes, and the other 80 is midterm and final. Makes it really demotivating at times because each assignment is only 1% of your grade."
"This course really expands my thinking as a mathematician. It starts easy and gradually builds up the level of difficulty. Some assignment questions near the end of the course really take time, but also intriguing. I could spend a day just to finish an assignment without being bored. Overall, this is my favorite course in 1A and I did learn a lot of fun stuff."
"Learning how to do proofs...well, this course wasn't very interesting especially if you are not of the math type. Assignments are difficult. Midterm was easy and final was easy-fair though."
Interesting course was generally fun to learn its contents. Assignments were more difficult than midterm though...
Pretty challenging course for someone coming out of a standard high school curriculum. Bunch of theorems that you need to know when and where to apply. Logical thinking this course taught is useful throughout your undergrad degree
"BE WARNED! This course is VERY challenging for those who are starting to do proofs. A lot of things get thrown at you very quickly, and it is hard to keep track of everything. Assignments took VERY long each week. Definitely NOT an easy course."
"It's kind of hard for students who are in 1A term because it takes time to get used to this course. The assignments are always much harder than the content, which needs to be improved."
"Was my favourite course in 1A, taught you a different way of thinking and approaching problems. It is a difficult course, but if you read the textbook and do lots and lots of practice problems you will be fine."
For someone with no history in writing programs this was a very cool course. Lectures were difficult to pay attention to but I liked the overall skill set I came out of the course with. Also learned that coding can be very frustrating (you can easily get stuck at a road block for significant amounts of time) yet very rewarding (no better feeling than finally getting your program to run)
"By far the most interesting course of 1A. Teaching proof techniques is the main focus of the course, and is done quite well -- but all the topics that we touched on (gcd, complex numbers, modular arithmetic), were interesting too! One assignment a week, which usually took 3-6 hours, plus three Mobius quizzes a week, open for 24 hours each. The midterm was challenging but still fair, and the final was much easier. My only regret is not taking MATH 145 instead. If you are anywhere near the Euclid score cutoff, you should apply for the advanced courses instead -- you will likely find 135 to be fairly easy."
Very hard course. Got bumped up to a 60 after failing the exam and got fucked over in math 136. I however would not do this course again and would not wish this course upon my greatest enemy. It is hell.
"Essential course, taught me to think differently than before I took it."
The first half of the course was super easy and then the course took a turn for the worst. The quizzes are pretty easy but the assignments can be extremely tough - so I suggest that you do not start them at the last minute.
The most difficult course in my 1A. Really suffered.
Pretty interesting course. Mobius quizzes were quite easy but set aside a fair amount of time for written assignments as they tend to get much more difficult post midterm.
Very useful course
"Was fun at first as it's similar to competitive math, but as the term goes on and assignments pile, it's not that great. Assignments are based somewhat on the material but it will take a long time just to finish one question."
Very interesting and useful course. Pay attention to the lectures as some of the content will show up in upper year math courses.
"This course is taught in an archaic language that no one uses and no one understands. Instructors' explanations are irrelevant to actual questions and I got yelled during office hrs even though I stated that I need a little patience (I am disabled). Assignments and quizzes are unreasonably hard. I took to take this for bioinformatics option and decided to change my future career. Truly the worst in UW history. If you don't need this course, run."
"I actually enjoyed this course. It was a lot of new stuff for me but nothing too hard to get. Assignments were impossible to do alone so I had to go to office hours every week or talk with friends or go to tutorial centre to solve everything. The textbook is pretty useful, has some good examples."
"Course was easy until immediately after the midterm, where it suddenly ramped up in difficulty (RSA in particular threw me for a loop). Assignments were much harder than any of the exams, so don't be discouraged if you can't do them. People hype this course up - it's challenging, but not impossible to do well in."
"Can't really speak to its usefulness, but it is a tough course for most people. It's very different from what we've been learning so far so make sure you attend lectures and do the assignments. Do not procrastinate on the assignments as you will regret this when midterms or finals come around. Practice using the theorems and practice the different proofs. Midterm and final are quite reasonable if you put in the work during the term. Final has a couple computation questions which are your easy marks so make sure you get those!"
Very interesting course. Demands a lot but teaches a lot as well
It's a great course. Well organized and building a fundamental basis for our mathematical intuition. It also combines how the elegance of writing and math.
"Very interesting course, material can be challenging but that is part of why I liked it."
Quite an interesting course.
Amazing course! you'll either love it or hate it lol. Need to go to lectures and keep up with the assignments to do well. Textbook is very useful! Choose your prof wisely as that will impact your grade significantly.
Hardest course I've taken yet. Manageable with ample studying and practicing though.
"Never taken anything even remotely related and this was super easy. Read the modules, take a couple hours each week to do assignments, easy enough midterm and final."
"Personally I thought the course was really easy-- at first. But don't let yourself slack off, because otherwise you will find yourself easily confused and lost as you fall further behind. Material gets harder as course moves along. Course material is still very relevant in other courses and in the future."
"Fairly easy course overall, enjoyed the class a lot. Carrie Knoll was an excellent lecturer."
