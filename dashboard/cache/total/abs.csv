"This course really expands my thinking as a mathematician. It starts easy and gradually builds up the level of difficulty. Assignments take some time, so leave a few hours aside for them.","The most disgusting piece of content that I have ever learnt in my life. The lectures are often useless because instead of actually explaining how to solve problems, the whole lecture is wasted on proving random theorems that we will never be expected to prove. Assignments and quizzes are unreasonably hard.",The racket language used in this course is easy to follow but not very useful. Assignments were impossible to do alone so I had to go to office hours every week or talk with friends or go to tutorial centre.
