math student who took this course since I had 0 prior programming experience. The racket language used in this course is easy to follow but not very useful. The Mobius assignments (quizzes) were free marks if you put enough time/effort into them.,"no need to read the textbook, the course notes are enough. Spent only about a maximum of 4-5 hours per week. Ended up with a 93.math student who took this course since I had 0 prior programming experience.","Not a bird course online imo, instructors barely interact, and almost no practice material is given (outside of a textbook with bad quizzes). A nice course where proofs really take a while to click and understand."
"So Easy. Just follow the course notes. It literally tells you how to do everything you need to do. Assignments take some time, so leave a few hours aside for them.",So Easy. Just follow the course notes. Reading the textbook was a much bigger help than attending lectures. Midterms were easy if you made notes and understood the concepts. Birdiest course I've ever taken.,Nafeez doesn't allow photos to be taken of her notes so you couldn't even take a picture to give you time to listen. The only reason I did good was that I took Econ in high school lol.
"Took this in 2018 with no programming experience ever. Started out pretty slow, but I didn't really pay attention and was severely behind. Went to a lot of office hours, but nonetheless caught up and did decently well. After taking more cs courses, racket really is a weird language.","This is a good introductory course to learn programming. Not a bird course, although if you have background in programming it would not be difficult at all. Joke course if you're a CS major who is taking it just to get a good CAV.",Really easy course. Especially if you have coded before. Assignments get a little harder at the end but both the midterm and finals were easy. The only thing I hated about this course was how annoying using Dr. Racket can be.
"Easy final. Pay attention and do the assignments--that should more than prepare you for the course. SO easy, didn't pay attention in the lectures, just used course notes. It gets easier and just do tons of practise questions.","SO easy, didn't pay attention in the lectures, just used course notes. Don't get too lost and give up at the beginning of the course. It gets easier and just do tons of practise questions.",CNN.com will feature iReporter photos in a weekly Travel Snapshots gallery. Please submit your best shots of New Zealand for next week.

"If you were serious about contest maths in high school, this course is an easy 90+. Anton is just absolutely goated -- if you have the chance, join in on one of his lectures or even just read his lecture notes.","This course is an easy 90+. Anton is just absolutely goated -- if you have the chance, join in on one of his lectures or even just read his lecture notes!","It is a difficult course, but if you read the textbook and do lots and lots of practice problems you will be fine. Was my favourite course in 1A, taught you a different way of thinking and approaching problems."
Hardest Class in 1A! Study until your hand hurts from those proofs. Exams are much easier than the assignments. Concepts were easy to understand - application is the harder part.,"Easy bird course for any student looking to fill an elective. Concepts were easy to understand - application is the harder part. First half is deceptively easy, second half gets much more difficult.","taught terribly, seems so unorganized and the actual midterm/exam questions are different to the ones you use on pearson. Came in with no prior knowledge, skipped every lecture, studied 4h per exam, ended with low 90s."
"The only way to do bad in this course is by not managing ur time properly. As a science student with no background knowledge of business/economics, its not too easy.",Easiest CS course this university has to offer. Anton is a great prof who actually cares about his students. Make sure you go to Yu-Ru's office hours if you can because she gives so many helpful hints.,"Very hard course. Got bumped up to a 60 after failing the exam and got fucked over in math 136. Poorly taught, unengaging, and difficult at times (for a first year with no prior economics experience)"
mmend him since he doesn't post notes online for students to catch up. Go with profs who (may go fast with their lectures but) post their notes online. A lot of memorizing and understanding of graphs.,This course really expands my thinking as a mathematician. It starts easy and gradually builds up the level of difficulty. The most important thing about the course I'd say is PRACTICE!,This course kills a part of me. It is quite possibly the driest course I have taken at Waterloo so far. The hardest part of this course is trying to muster the motivation to learn about the stupidest concepts ever.
plex numbers is less useful than the practice students get writing proofs. You gotta get used to proofs if you're a math student. You will learn how to actually think mathematically since you probably don't know yet.,"The first half of the course was much more enjoyable and useful imo It's pretty much an introduction to computer science concepts like recursion,BSTs and other abstract data types. If you have done many proofs in high school, easy 90+ as an online course.",CNN.com will feature iReporter photos in a weekly Travel Snapshots gallery.

"Quizzes and tests are not hard, a joyful course, no pressure. Entire mark composed of two midterms and a final. All exams are multiple choice Like it.nts are common sense, but as someone who has never taken econ in high school, I find that there are several unjustified claims in the modules.","The course content had nonexistent explanations, motivation, applications, citations or justifications. There were a lot of erroneous questions (like two MCQ choices are the same) on the quizzes, midterms and final. I recommend finding a course with a language that is actually useful.",CNN.com will feature iReporter photos in a weekly Travel Snapshots gallery.
