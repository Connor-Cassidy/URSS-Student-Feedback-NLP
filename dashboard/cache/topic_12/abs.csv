The majority of this course is exceedingly easy if you already know programming basics. Take CS 135 or 145 if you have prior programming experience. All course contents are based on a website and you have to read everything and code something on that website.,"math student who took this course since I had 0 prior programming experience. The racket language used in this course is easy to follow but not very useful. If you feel like you have sufficient Computer Science experience, go to CS 135 because it does challenge you more.",Really easy course. Especially if you have coded before. Assignments get a little harder at the end but both the midterm and finals were easy. The only thing I hated about this course was how annoying using Dr. Racket can be.
"SO easy, didn't pay attention in the lectures, just used course notes. Reading the textbook was a much bigger help than attending lectures. Wasted my elective on this when I could have taken much better courses.","SO easy, didn't pay attention in the lectures, just used course notes. Reading the textbook was a much bigger help than attending lectures. Midterms were easy if you made notes and understood the concepts.",Not easy if you have no previous knowledge on the subject. Went through chapters just about every other class so it was very fast paced. A waste of my time. Should have taken my transfer credit from AP.
It's totally worth the hassle to override into this course even if you're not in the math faculty. Anton is a great prof who actually cares about his students. This is a beautiful course if you can appreciate math and logic.,"So Easy. Just follow the course notes. It literally tells you how to do everything you need to do. Assignments take some time, so leave a few hours aside for them. Otherwise this class is super easy.","This course is taught in an archaic language that no one uses and no one understands. Unless you have some sort of economic background, you will be struggling through teaching yourself this course. Getting and reading the textbook is a must!"
"Very easy course if you keep up with the material and do the assignments. Takes a lot of practice, especially before major assessments, so keeping on top of assignments and quizzes helps a lot.","Interesting material, but truly quite difficult. Takes a lot of practice, especially before major assessments. Assignments can be challenging so start those as soon as possible. Midterm was not easy but finals was quite light.",The most difficult course in my 1A. Really suffered. It was the hardest course I've ever had to do. I'm so glad I did it.
"First course that teaches you what UW math is all about. All multiple choice, all about memory and understanding. One of the easiest courses in first year. Super fun and well run course.","Arguably the hardest course in 1A for any first year in the faculty of mathematics. First half is deceptively easy, second half gets much more difficult, especially exam.",The hardest part of this course is trying to muster the motivation to learn about the stupidest concepts ever. First course that teaches you what UW math is all about.
"This course is interesting and easy before the midterm. Still interesting after the midterm but it is super hard. Only 3 exams, two midterms and a final throughout the whole course.",This course is interesting and easy before the midterm. Still interesting after the midterm but it is super hard. Got 100 on the first midterm stopped going to class after that. Managed to get 100 on all midterms after that and ended with a 98 final mark.,Learn nothing but gain a super high mark. Good course for those who want to switch programs or apply coop. Everything is common sense so nothing needs to memory.
"The majority of the course was quite easy, except a couple of concept checks that were RIDICULOUSLY HARD. The only way to do bad in this course is by not managing ur time properly.","For someone with no history in writing programs this was a very cool course. Make sure you fully understand theorems, lemmas, etc if you want to do well. Do not take with Wokia because you can't understand anything.",Very hard course. Got bumped up to a 60 after failing the exam and got fucked over in math 136. Would not do this course again and would not wish this course upon my greatest enemy.
"The course forces you to really understand proof techniques, and how exactly to prove things. If you do poorly in this course, you're probably not cut out for ""real"" math.","Very fun class with interesting, albeit not very applicable material. Gives an intro to writing proofs by reading proofs, very well taught course. Great if you love number theory.",CNN.com will feature iReporter photos in a weekly Travel Snapshots gallery.

"Mike Cooper-Stachowsky is an amazing lecturer, but even then, I couldn't find myself engaged in the content. The Mobius assignments (quizzes) were free marks if you put enough time/effort into them. There are zero synchronous lectures, so be prepared to spend circa 3-5 hours every week trying to memorize the course content.","imes, but a very rewarding and fun course. Start assignments early and definitely go to office hours. TAs and ISAs are very helpful. Olivia Mesta was a great professor.","The only reason I did good was that I took Econ in high school. Not a bird course online imo, instructors barely interact, and almost no practice material is given (outside of a textbook with bad quizzes)"
Pretty challenging course for someone coming out of a standard high school curriculum. Bunch of theorems that you need to know when and where to apply. Logical thinking this course taught is useful throughout your undergrad degree.,Pretty challenging course for someone coming out of a standard high school curriculum. Bunch of theorems that you need to know when and where to apply. Logical thinking this course taught is useful throughout your undergrad degree.,"The worst class, so boring, so dry. Learn one thing, and you know it all. Still get the chills from Econ 101, worst mark in my academic career."
"Was my favourite course in 1A, taught you a different way of thinking and approaching problems. Demands a lot but teaches a lot as well. Problems on assignments and exams are fun, but challenging.","This course really expands my thinking as a mathematician. It starts easy and gradually builds up the level of difficulty. Some assignment questions near the end of the course really take time, but also intriguing.","Was my favourite course in 1A, taught you a different way of thinking and approaching problems. The midterm was setup poorly - the focus was not on core concepts but on the exactness of the stepping problems."
"Super easy if you do it online, there was no midterm and the final was going to be all multiple choice (except it was cancelled due to the pandemic). A lot of the content was just common sense, which makes this a good course to do online because going to lectures would be pretty useless.","Super easy if you do it online, there was no midterm and the final was going to be all multiple choice.
