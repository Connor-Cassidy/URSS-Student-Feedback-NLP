"math student who took this course since I had 0 prior programming experience. the course isn't horribly hard, but if you fall behind or don't understand one lesson, everything following will be super challenging. the course was mostly online completing modules, and my biggest criticism is that solutions for lessons are never posted after they are due which makes it super challenging to do the next week's module if you didn't understand/didnt know how to write a specific code for the week. the racket language used in this course is easy to follow but not very useful and isn't used anywhere. this makes it difficult to find help outside of cs115 profs/ta's/past cs115 students. the course is oddly paced, felt the super easy and simple first half of the course, and then gets unreasonably fast. didn't find any of the profs/ta's answers to questions posted on discussion boards useful at all. because the course was only offered online, I had to essentially had to teach the whole course to myself","SO easy, didn't pay attention in the lectures, just used course notes.","It's kind of hard for students who are in 1A term because it takes time to get used to this course. The assignments are always much harder than the content, which needs to be improved.",Very easy course if you keep up with the material and do the assignments.,"This course is great for anyone that is interested in math. It is quite different from high school math courses, as it is a whole new way of approaching mathematical problems. The course goes over techniques of proofs, which are the building blocks of many future math courses. The later half of the course goes over some number theory, I found it sufficiently challenging but still interesting. In terms of course load there are weekly assignments, but they are not too bad if you start early, and you are allowed to ask instructors for help. Be warned that the exams are fairly difficult though. Overall, a great course for any math enthusiasts to take.",This course is interesting and easy before the midterm. Still interesting after the midterm but it is super hard. I took it twice and still couldn't get a good grade,For someone with no history in writing programs this was a very cool course. Lectures were difficult to pay attention to but I liked the overall skill set I came out of the course with. Also learned that coding can be very frustrating (you can easily get stuck at a road block for significant amounts of time) yet very rewarding (no better feeling than finally getting your program to run),This course teaches proof techniques which I assume that will be used a lot in future math courses and ended with lots of calculation. It was neither hard nor hard but I learned how to manage time wisely (took some time to get used to first-year university math tho).,"Fair difficulty but very tedious/annoying proofs on weekly written assignments (15-22h each week for me, to achieve low 90s on average) that just made me not want to see a proof ever again. Mike Cooper-Stachowsky is an amazing lecturer, but even then, I couldn't find myself engaged in the content apart from the concept (not proofs - those were not engaging) of modular arithmetic and RSA encryption. The Mobius assignments (quizzes) were free marks if you put enough time/effort into them since they had 3 attempts each, and oftentimes there were some questions that just took away so much of my sanity that I gave up and settled for a lower grade.",Pretty challenging course for someone coming out of a standard high school curriculum. Bunch of theorems that you need to know when and where to apply. Logical thinking this course taught is useful throughout your undergrad degree,"Was my favourite course in 1A, taught you a different way of thinking and approaching problems. It is a difficult course, but if you read the textbook and do lots and lots of practice problems you will be fine.","Super easy if you do it online, there was no midterm and the final was going to be all multiple choice (except it was cancelled due to the pandemic). There was one multiple choice quiz every week. A lot of the content was just common sense, which makes this a good course to do online because going to lectures would be pretty useless."
"If you feel like you have sufficient Computer Science experience, go to CS 135 because it does challenge you more. This is a good introductory course to learn programming. Also, Racket needs some getting used to.",Honestly a really straightforward and boring class. Reading the textbook was a much bigger help than attending lectures. Midterms were easy if you made notes and understood the concepts.,"The most disgusting piece of content that I have ever learnt in my life. This course is so useless and unnecessarily complicated. The lectures are often useless because instead of actually explaining how to solve problems, the whole lecture is wasted on proving random theorems that we will never be expected to prove. If you do bad on the midterm, don't give up as the content gets much better next term which means it is still possible for you to recover your mark. As far as I saw, the first part of the course is tough to wrap your head around for most people but the post midterm content is more computational and easier to understand. If you can take the course online then do it since assignments and quizzes are weighted higher and the exams are online as well.","Interesting material, but truly quite difficult. Takes a lot of practice, especially before major assessments, so keeping on top of assignments and quizzes helps a lot.",Amazing course! you'll either love it or hate it lol. Need to go to lectures and keep up with the assignments to do well. Textbook is very useful! Choose your prof wisely as that will impact your grade significantly.,"Materials before the midterm were very easy, the course gets a bit harder after the midterm. But if you do all your assignments, you should be able to do well on the exam easily.","This is most definitely the hardest course I had in 1A. I guess I'm not really a proofs person. I would definitely recommend going to tutoring in residence - it's very useful for completing assignments and generally understanding some of the material. If you don't understand what the prof is talking about in class, make sure you clarify with them. Get help when you need it before it's too late.","It gives you a first insight of mathematical proofs;a very easy course,but the knowledge taught will be repeatedly used in upper-year math.",Pretty interesting course. Mobius quizzes were quite easy but set aside a fair amount of time for written assignments as they tend to get much more difficult post midterm.,Pretty interesting course. As someone who never did Econ prior to this course it was important to keep up with all the new content as concepts tend to build on each other. Trust the test bank and you'll end up with high 90s,"Very useful course. Really enjoyed applying proof techniques to different questions. Although somewhere around (Assignment 4+), assignment difficulty went from stupidly easy to incredibly difficult and it could take upwards of 15 hours to complete a problem set.",Easiest course I've ever taken. No need to go to class or get the textbook. If you just read the slides the night before the midterms and exam you should be able to get a high 90. It's 100% multiple choice and mostly common sense.
"I took this course online due to the COVID-19 pandemic, so my review is based on a remote, online learning experience. Overall, as someone who is not a CS student and who doesn't have a lot of background experience and knowledge in programming, it's a great introductory course to the language of Racket and the overall concepts that will be useful in later computer science courses. The Racket language itself is not a very ""useful"" language that you may or may not use in later CS courses and even in a job, but the foundation it provides is very valuable and will definitely make you think more mathematically at programming problems. The difficulty of this course starts to increase after the midterm exam, and it does get pretty tough nearing the end. I recommend starting the assignments as early as possible and attend as many office hours if you have any questions. The course staff are very responsive and do offer a good amount of help depending on your questions. Overall, I can't say much about the in-person learning experience, but this course was suited well for online learning and I enjoyed it.","do not take this as an elective unless coding/math is easy for you! there are a lot of concepts, impossible to teach yourself from the course notes because of how poorly organized they are. lectures are impossibly boring. My best friend tutors this class and I still justtttt scraped by. language is not super useful in life. many of my friends have taken this course because they heard it was easy and ended up failing.","So Easy. Just follow the course notes. It literally tells you how to do everything you need to do. Assignments take some time, so leave a few hours aside for them. Otherwise this class is super easy.",Useful course. Assignments get a lot harder after the midterm.,The first half of the course was super easy and then the course took a turn for the worst. The quizzes are pretty easy but the assignments can be extremely tough - so I suggest that you do not start them at the last minute.,"I feel like it's too early in my academic career to speak of the usefulness of this course. I will agree with what others have said, pre-midterm this class is really not tough. In fact my advice would be to squeeze all the marks you can pre-midterm, by doing this you are able to save your dropped assignment for the second half when assignments become a lot harder and you can go into the exam being able to pass the course with a fail on the exam. Also go to office hours and start assignments early, they're a great help.","Reviewing as a science major, this course was definitely the one that set me up with programming. Even though it was Dr. Racket, concepts were easy to follow. Be sure to go ask a lot of questions if you do not understand.",It's a great course. Well organized and building a fundamental basis for our mathematical intuition. It also combines how the elegance of writing and math.,"Took it online during covid-19. Some of the assignments were very challenging, but the exams were usually pretty easy, and our grades were hyper inflated.",Easy course if you NEVER took econ before.. probably extremely boring if you have taken econ before. All exams are multiple choice,"this is a really great and interesting course! There is a lot of learning to do, and you do need a very consistent work ethic in order to keep up with course content. Practice makes perfect!","Came in with no prior knowledge, skipped every lecture, studied 4h per exam, ended with low 90s."
Take CS 135 or 145 if you have prior programming experience. The majority of this course is exceedingly easy if you already know programming basics. It may only possibly get difficult at the very end. The design recipe and templates are the hardest thing for the majority of the course.,Easy final. Pay attention and do the assignments--that should more than prepare you for the course.,"I actually enjoyed this course. It was a lot of new stuff for me but nothing too hard to get. Assignments were impossible to do alone so I had to go to office hours every week or talk with friends or go to tutorial centre to solve everything. The textbook is pretty useful, has some good examples.",Interesting course. Assignments can be challenging so start those as soon as possible. Midterm and Final were straightforward.,"Great course with emphasis on proofs covering many topics. Some of the proofs can be pretty challenging to figure out, but are rewarding upon completion. Start your assignments early and don't be afraid to ask friends or your prof for clues to assignment problems if you are stuck.",Honestly I struggled with the course more than I should have in hindsight. But don't despair if you get a bad midterm mark - if you work hard you can improve your mark in the final.,Very hard course. Got bumped up to a 60 after failing the exam and got fucked over in math 136. I however would not do this course again and would not wish this course upon my greatest enemy. It is hell.,"Interesting topic, first time seeing proofs like this maybe useful for upper year math courses. Very difficult in-person but online is much easier, grading is unfair and depends on the prof (some profs gave extra bonus questions, etc). Pick Anton’s class if you can he is the best.","I found this course to be very challenging. might have been because I did not like my profs teaching style. proofs were nothing I have done or seen before so math135 was very new to me. the textbook isn't very useful to learn how to come up with proofs that were on any of the assessments. the weekly assignments were extremely difficult and took the average student around 5-10 hours a week to complete. weekly quizzes were good to assess textbook understanding. as someone who struggled in this course, i have to say the responses on piaaza were essentially useless when i asked questions about the course content, their response everything was a direct quotation from the textbook, or if they were feeling extra lazy would just say 'look at the course notes'.","The worst class, so boring, so dry. Learn one thing, and you know it all though.","This course really expands my thinking as a mathematician. It starts easy and gradually builds up the level of difficulty. Some assignment questions near the end of the course really take time, but also intriguing. I could spend a day just to finish an assignment without being bored. Overall, this is my favorite course in 1A and I did learn a lot of fun stuff.","Took online, almost all multiple choice, a lot of questions are common sense"
"Nice course that teaches you how to write simple code. But little annoying that you have to do Design Recipe (especially writing an explanation for codes). There is no loop in DrRacket so being able to understand recursion is important. All course contents are based on a website and you have to read everything and code something on that website. Pity that this course will not show many algorithms or data structures. So far I think those who can just play computer games (i.e. no coding experience but can easily type using the keyboard) can easily get 90+ in this course. If you have ever coded like C, python, java, pascal and so on, easy to get 95+. Idk why the easy rate goes so low but trust me, super easy course if you finish reading the material (okay reading part may be a little boring and CS 135 provide detailed intros which seem not wordy)",Not easy if you have no previous knowledge on the subject. Went through chapters just about every other class so it was very fast paced,"It's the worst course ever, online especially. They are least interested to teach. They just provided the content to read by ourselves. I wouldn't suggest anyone to take this course online.","This course isn't easy. It takes a lot of hard work from your end to get a good mark. As the semester progresses, the concepts get harder. That is, at first, they can sound very confusing and intimidating. However, with a lot of practice and patience, you can relate to the topics more effectively. The proofs come to you with patience. Don't get discouraged if you are not able to solve them right away.","Learning proofs was useful in the first half of the course, after that it was all useless bs. Assignments were all about finding little tricks, not actually testing the content.","Really easy course. Only 3 exams, two midterms and a final throughout the whole course. Only went to a couple of classes and still passed decently.",Sedra Smith recommended me this course so I don't end up like one of those pig 4 students. I did very well and am happy about my life choices.,A very interesting class that teaches you the fundamentals of proofs and abstract algebra. Essential for anybody who wants to have a basic understanding of how math works. This ain't your high school math anymore.,"Not that hard compared with MATH 137. Quizzes and written assignments constitute a large portion of the final grade. Written assignments are usually hard, which takes days to complete. It is recommended to participate in office hours when instructors usually give hints for the assignments.","I took this class in F2020 thinking it was birdy, I guess I just suck ass at Economics. The weekly modules were dry for me, this is just my opinion I know quite a few people who find Econ fascinating. The professor's presence was non-existence. Overall a 5/10 for me.","Really interesting course, makes you explore a whole new way of understanding mathematics. Unfortunately, if you're in-person only 20% of your grade is from assignments and quizzes, and the other 80 is midterm and final. Makes it really demotivating at times because each assignment is only 1% of your grade.",Easy bird course. Multiple choice ftw.
Really easy course. Especially if you have coded before. Assignments get a little harder at the end but both the midterm and finals were easy. The only thing I hated about this course was how annoying using Dr. Racket can be at times.,hard course. boring. make sure to keep up with the textbook readings otherwise you will struggle. take time to go over the chapter before the lecture cause the lectures only help if you know what youre going to learning. dont recommend taking it if its not mandatory.,"This course is taught in an archaic language that no one uses and no one understands. Instructors' explanations are irrelevant to actual questions and I got yelled during office hrs even though I stated that I need a little patience (I am disabled). Assignments and quizzes are unreasonably hard. I took to take this for bioinformatics option and decided to change my future career. Truly the worst in UW history. If you don't need this course, run.","The course was not very hard. The language used was Scheme, which I did not like and found it to be very tedious. It is not as fun as other languages. The course however was good overall.","This course feels more like a logic course. It covered a lot of topics, but the concept is very fun to learn(depending on your prof). The first part of the class was fairly intuitive. The second part gets more complicated, but it was still interesting overall.","Never taken anything even remotely related and this was super easy. Read the modules, take a couple hours each week to do assignments, easy enough midterm and final.","The course was like an edible that's too strong. At first everything is great and you think it's soft but you just keep coming up. As it progresses, the intensity only increases and can become overwhelming and you may not like it. If you don't like your prof I would recommend skipping your lectures and using the mobius lessons. They are much more concise and you can be sure that you will not miss something covered on the assignments. Also the feedback part can be very similar to the quizzes. Overall it was very rewarding to finish the course, but just beware that it becomes more time consuming towards the end.","Proofs! The harder problem solving works out to be either you know it or you don't know it, so you basically just have to do a lot of problem solving and maybe something will stick. This course is good for writing proofs in other courses later.","Other than some of the oligarchy content and some of the material in the beginning, this course was just a knowledge dump of a bunch of microeconomic content. You won't retain anything that you learn at all. quizzes/exams were multiple choice, which weren't too bad if you took it online. Mark also consisted of 2 discussion boards, which were engaging (but you get penalized if someone responds to your post 30 minutes before its due and you don't reply back because its 11pm at night)",Boring course,"I honestly didn't find this course too bad. Writing proofs seems daunting at first, but with practice, you'll start to be able to think in that manner and it will become much easier. I would caution relying on others for help too much though- I think the best way to screw yourself over in this course is to not keep pushing even when you get stuck on a question (Which happens a lot).",
Pretty easy straight forward introductory CS course. People complain but scheme syntax but personally I don't mind prefix notation at all.,Birdiest course I've ever taken. Don't even need to go to lectures just study from the textbook and solve the exam bank questions. The version of the textbook doesn't matter so don't waste money on a newer version.,"i had to take this course twice and when i tell you i hated it, that is an understatement",the course is hard but definitely manageable. don't stress over the assignments because they are worth so little. rather you should try to understand the content on a much deeper level. that goes a long way,"pretty useful for the first year, for math courses generally. basically all of them have proofs of some sort and this course teaches you how to handle proofs really easily, basically formulaically. great prof and course notes too",Super easy course. Got 100 on the first midterm stopped going to class after that because couldn't bother with an 8:30am class. Managed to get 100 on all midterms after that and ended with a 98 final mark.,"Don't start assignments the night before they're due, stay on top of your work and make sure to understand key concepts as the course builds on itself. Should be a breeze if you play your cards right.",I read somewhere that this course basically teaches you how to math. I second that.,"This course wasn't actually that bad but I still didn't like it. It was 1 module and quiz a week which was really easy at the beginning and end of the course. Some parts in the middle of the course made no sense and the questions made even less sense. The basics of supply & demand, elasticity, and types of markets are the only useful takeaways from the course. A lot of the course is common sense and I regret actually taking this course. The discussion posts were easy and the quizzes & exams were medium difficulty.","I took this asynchronous so I can't say necessarily the same is true for in-person, but the course was overall really dry. As a disclaimer I never took econ before in high school. The course content had nonexistent explanations, motivation, applications, citations or justifications. It reminded me of memorisation-heavy high school courses that feed you information, never explaining why they are true or why you would ever need to know them. Some reviews below claim that most statements are common sense, but as someone who has never taken econ in high school, I find that there are several unjustified claims in the modules, such as ""why is ATC minimized when MC=AVC?"" I later found a proof of this using calculus, but nonetheless there is zero reason to expect this to be true using ""common sense"", nor was there any reasoning of this in the module. There were a lot of erroneous questions (like two MCQ choices are the same) on the quizzes, midterms and final, and you don't get the answers after each quiz, so overall the quality of the presentation and assessments were likewise nonexistent. They claim they hide the answers for copyright reasons but 90% of the questions can be found on quizlet. The textbook was completely unnecessary. Further, the prof's presence was nonexistent. First asynchronous course though, so I'm not sure if all asynchronous courses are as garbage as this one.","Essential course, taught me to think differently than before I took it.",
Since I had prior programming experience this course seemed kind of useless. The language is good for teaching though.,Very interesting and useful course. Pay attention to the lectures as some of the content will show up in upper year math courses.,"Was fun at first as it's similar to competitive math, but as the term goes on and assignments pile, it's not that great. Assignments are based somewhat on the material but it will take a long time just to finish one question.","I found the course hard since it's not like anything we learned in high school. There were a lot of proofs and algorithms, which I'm not good at. However, the course is very interesting and I enjoyed it.",Hardest course I've taken yet. Manageable with ample studying and practicing though.,Course is super easy,People who like computer science will like this course.,"Hard course, but fundamental math concepts taught.","PROS: (1) Readings itself were simple to understand. (2) Nicely arranged content on Learn and Mobius (I took it online). (3) Decent grade, task, and submission period distribution. CONS: (1) Too many readings for a first-time learner of econ. (2) One collective zoom office hour (1 hour long) at the beginning of the week felt very unfair (3) Found a need for more OHs each week and a MS teams GC. (4) Felt isolated from the rest of the class. (5) lack of one-to-one instructional support (unless you email every question). (6) Had to refer to external resources for quicker understanding because readings were too time consuming. (7) Weren't taught at all on how to approach an article/case study. TIPS: (1) Finish all readings in the first two days of the week, (2) repeat quizzes till you get them correct (you get 4 chances per graded quiz every week, please use these well). (3) Don’t just read to study, answer a lot of MCQs.","Difficult course coming out of high school. The computational stuff wasn't bad (just involved practice) but, as others have said, proofs were the tough. I think the whole idea is to transition your mind from just computational/plug and play mathematics (the only kind you get exposed to in high school) to more creative thinking based mathematics.",In my opinion one of the best run courses. Does a great job of introducing a new perspective on math.,
"Not a bird course, although if you have background in programming it would not be difficult at all. Racket is somewhat useless but I learned some concepts that will be useful for other programming languages","Taken Online: I took this course because at one point I wanted to be a business student, this course taught me that it wasn't really for me in the end. Great bird course, really only skimmed notes before quizzes and crammed before finals and midterms. I wish I paid more attention so I could take 102 for the 3 prerequisite chain.",One of my favorite courses of all time. It's a breather from other courses since it really tests your logic and problem-solving skills. Each question feels like a fun puzzle.,The most difficult course in my 1A. Really suffered.,"A great course, but a little strange if you're used to object oriented programming.","Took it as a CSE, highest graded CSE course I have on record. Multiple choice midterm and final exams. Skipped couple lectures, but studying only the optional assignments and practice exams guaranteed a 100%","As someone who was nervous about proofs going into the course, I found that this course introduced them well! While I struggled with some of the concepts, I found proving things to be fun and sometimes even satisfying.","Omg, one bitch of a course. But it got interesting later on. It shows you how to formalize your proofs and give you a better understanding of proof techniques used later on.","Before midterms, super soft. After the first week of midterms, complete hell. Go to office hours for written assignments. Mobius assignments are free marks","Still get the chills from Econ 101, worst mark in my academic career.","This course teaches a completely new concept for most, proofs. Once you understand how to build a proof, the course gets easier, however some students never figure that part out. I think the pacing of the course is really well. My biggest piece of advice is to do the assignments by yourself. Struggling through and failing is how you learn. This is what will allow you to figure out exactly what theorems and techniques to use when which is the key to doing well overall. I personally really enjoyed proofs by the end of the course as it is a refreshing way to look at mathematics and if you truly love math you will love this course. That being said, the course is very professor dependent, so different professors provide very different experiences in this course.",
"I have never coded before so i opted to take this rather than CS135. This was really easy for me. I'm glad I took it though becuase it saved time so I can focus more on actual courses for my major (MATH145, PHYS121 etc). Don't expect to be able to code anything after this, especial since you use dr Raket. And the design recipes are a pain, my tip is put 20 test cases for everything.","Just read the textbook and slides, actual lectures seems to be pretty useless","I've never experienced a more terribly structured course than this one. You're basically left to teach yourself everything because the lectures are so incredibly boring, there's no way you're actually learning anything if you attend. Your time is much better spent not going, and just cramming at the end of the term & before the midterms of course. However, you're really just better off taking something that will actually teach you something useful. Don't take this as an elective if it's not required for your degree. If you're in math you'll have friends in this course, and you'll feel the urge to take it with them, but don't! You will thank yourself. It's such a waste of time and effort.","This course is all about writing proofs. Most of the concepts were super interesting but writing the proofs was challenging. The course is designed really well as each chapter flows into the next, so you really understand the connections. Do the assignments yourself and try to do the extra practice before midterms and finals. I personally loved this course!",First half of the course was on proof techniques. The material covered was for the most part easy albeit a bit bland. Midterm was fairly straightforward as was the final exam.,"Basic econ stuff. If you took econ in high school, it'll be pretty easy. Otherwise you might have some trouble, but it's still decently basic stuff, and concepts that can be explained by YouTube videos. The majority of the midterm and final questions (all MC) are from test banks if you can get those. Entire mark composed of two midterms and a final.","Took it online in W21 during COVID, concepts were taught in an abstract mathematical manner, which was fine (as a math major) however the concepts themselves just couldn't engage me enough to engage with the course. I'm sure if you put in minimum effort like most students you'll pass the course.","Very fun class with interesting, albeit not very applicable material. Covers stuff like elementary number theory and touches briefly on fields. Gives an intro to writing proofs by reading proofs, very well taught course. Only regret is not taking the advanced.","Didn’t take any econ courses in high school. This course was really easy, no need to read the textbook, the course notes are enough. You get 12 weekly quizzes, 2 group discussions, 1 midterm and the final. The first weekly quiz is ungraded and then the marks of 10 best quizzes out of 11 are considered which amounts to 40% of your grade. We also have 2 group discussions worth 10% each which are very easy. You can easily get a 9/10 in the discussions. The midterm contained 50mcq and the final consisted of 50mcqs and 5 short answer questions. Prof kumase did some review sessions on webex occasionally. These are recorded and can help you understand the concepts more clearly. It’s definitely a bird course. Spent only about a maximum of 4-5 hours per week. Ended up with a 93.",Boring but easy.,"The course was relatively easy, but the midterm was setup poorly - the focus was not on core concepts but on the exactness of the stepping problems, which I don't think is useful at all.",
great intro course for students with no background experience in CS and who don't plan on pursuing CS in the future. It can be prof dependent though.,"Take the time to combine notes from lectures and the textbook. Overall concepts were simple, but often a bit boring to read about.","I did not enjoy the course at all as I found the course to be so incredibly dull. Personally this honestly had to be one of the hardest courses, but I guess it really is prof dependent, as the final exams this term weren't even the same and didn't even cover the same material.",Quite an interesting course.,Pretty easy course overall! I stopped going to labs about three weeks in and still managed to get the bonus 3%. The assignments were relatively easy (with one or two exceptions).,"No assignments no quiz, just two midterms and a final for my section. Boring but quite easy.","I recommend finding a course with a language that is actually useful. Racket is dumb and never used anywhere. The majority of the course was quite easy, except a couple of concept checks that were RIDICULOUSLY HARD. i wish i had realized sooner that you get 10% of concept checks dropped from your grade. if you understand everything and are getting most things easily but you get stumped on one particular concept check, its probably not your fault and you should skip it, at least for now. the course was very well structured and predictable. expectations were clear and reasonable. it actually was designed to be a correspondence course, so it wasnt an online course that was rushed and slapped together for covid.","Very insightful course. Great if you love number theory. Has more applications in pure math than in other areas, but useful nonetheless for proofs.","Took this course online. Your mark essentially consists of a series of 10 question multiple choice quizzes weekly, 2 discussions, and 2 fully multiple-choice exams. Definitely was not a ""hard"" course, but I definitely do not think this course was as easy as many made it seem. You will need to put in at least a fair bit of effort, time, and devotion into this course in order to ensure a good mark.","I have never thought of or seen math like this before in high school. Being introduced to this course has definitely expanded my horizons on how I see mathematics being applied in the world. It is a challenging course and some concepts are hard to wrap your mind around, however, with practice, it is a doable course. The structure is great and the course is well maintained by the faculty.",Very interesting course. Demands a lot but teaches a lot as well,
"Even though Scheme was a very weird language, it was still an easy course overall, read the modules and you will do well.","useless course, took it as an elective and i needed to work hard, not a bird course for me, never took business inn highschool and also didnt bother to buy the textbook, which couldve helped. lectures everyone were on their phones or playing games on their laptops.","Amazing and challenging course overall. It's totally worth the hassle to override into this course even if you're not in the math faculty. The assignments are brutal to complete as they require so much time to figure out. But I would advise everyone to do them all on their own as they're there for you to develop the thinking you need to succeed. Anyone can understand a solution, but coming up with it is the hard part. It may be very difficult to do this in-between 5 other courses (3 of which are even tougher than Math 135), but it is possible. Good time management skills can lead to you finding more time to work on assignments such as the 10 minutes in-between lectures. The solutions will often feel like it comes down to a lucky guess. In general, the professors are pretty amazing. The math faculty doesn't send random people with thick accents to teach all their first year courses. Even if you do fail, there's still 10 more sections in the winter term where they mark easier, and 2 more sections in the spring where exams get easier. This course makes you a way better thinker when it comes to solving problems, and you'll gain way more out of it than most courses. This course can be an amazing experience to anybody.",Really interesting course. I was lost in class but it was much better when I self studied. NOT AS HARD as people say it is.,"fun stuff, felt really amazing grasping the content by the end. do the assignments on your own, go to all the lectures, and do the randomized practice. you should be fine.","It starts with a very low pace but after midterm, it gets really fast and I cannot understand the content while reaching the end of term. Racket is restricted by so many things so I feel I lose the freedom of coding. The assignments are extremely hard after midterm, I spent a whole day on them but I can just solve the easiest one. The only positive impression that I have is that the design recipe weighs half so I pass this course successfully.","It is important to go to the lectures, because that is the determinant factor of your grade and how good you will understand the course content.","By far the most interesting course of 1A. Teaching proof techniques is the main focus of the course, and is done quite well -- but all the topics that we touched on (gcd, complex numbers, modular arithmetic), were interesting too! One assignment a week, which usually took 3-6 hours, plus three Mobius quizzes a week, open for 24 hours each. The midterm was challenging but still fair, and the final was much easier. My only regret is not taking MATH 145 instead. If you are anywhere near the Euclid score cutoff, you should apply for the advanced courses instead -- you will likely find 135 to be fairly easy.","where do I even start, horrible prof, horrible class, made no effort to teach, everything was taught through reading the textbook, the class was made up of weekly quizzes, a midterm, and exam, which were all BS. The only reason I did good was that I took Econ in high school lol.","A difficult course coming from high school. The proof techniques are definitely useful to know if you're heading into Pure Math or something, but less relevant to a CS major. Nice to know, still. Makes me feel smarter.","Course was easy until immediately after the midterm, where it suddenly ramped up in difficulty (RSA in particular threw me for a loop). Assignments were much harder than any of the exams, so don't be discouraged if you can't do them. People hype this course up - it's challenging, but not impossible to do well in.",
"Majority of the material is only for math students. As a CS student, I was incredibly bored most of the term.",i had conrad hewitt. i didn't learn anything in class because he went so fast. honestly the notes for this course are really well made. i just went to the tutorial centre at mkv to finish off all the assignments with a LOT of help. pulled a decent mark somehow tho,"Interesting course because problem-solving is interesting. However, sometimes it gets boring (i.e. prime number stuff, modular artihmetic) because you know that you'll never apply this knowledge in real life (at least for me personally). Assignments are really annoying because sometimes they allow for basic hand-waving and other times they arbitrarily demand absolute rigour. As a result, you have to constantly browse Piazza to see what you can hand-wave and what you can't.","BE WARNED! This course is VERY challenging for those who are starting to do proofs. A lot of things get thrown at you very quickly, and it is hard to keep track of everything. Assignments took VERY long each week. Definitely NOT an easy course.","Probably the hardest first year course, a course solely on how to prove things. It is invaluable if you are pursuing a cs degree however.",Pretty sure you have to be retarded to fail this course. Casual course to boost GPA. Literally you can jerk off do w.e the f*** you want in class. Just review slides b4 midterm/exam and your gucci.,"Don't really like this course, but love the prof YIchun Huang! If you have her, just go for it! Hint: she uses test banks","Took this in person F2020, it truly opened my eyes to the world of real mathematics. Well-organized course with quite a few amazing prof. I had Faisal, really enjoyed his lectures and he was active on Piazza as well. The first half of the class teaches you proof techniques and some basic mathematical logic (which you will see again in CS 245), then second half goes into elementary number theory stuff (prime numbers, division theorem, modulo) and complex numbers. The weekly assignments were tough and I always do them 2 or 3 days before deadline so it was not a nice experience at all so my tip is to start them asap and get help from instructor or TA whenever you get dead stuck. I regret not going to office hours and had to suffer hard.","Jokes class. Took it with a prof who does nothing from the textbook and I swear he made up the whole course. Midterms and final are an easy 90, if not 110",,This course requires a complete shift in the mathematical thinking that you have done in high school so expect to spend a bit of time to get it right and understand how to solve the questions. Otherwise memorize all the theorems and definitions and you will be fine.,
The programming language (Scheme/Dr.Racket) wasn't a very good program to use but the concepts behind it are the same I guess ...,hard as hell... get a tutor and pay attention in class. do the assignments on your own as much as possible,"I can see the course being useful for other students, however I don't see the application to my daily life personally. I disliked this course strongly, due to my struggle with math and economic concepts, and was unfortunately required to take this course. Would not have taken it otherwise.",Very useful course,"When I say easy, take it in moderation. To many people, this will be the hardest 1A course you have.","Can't really speak to its usefulness, but it is a tough course for most people. It's very different from what we've been learning so far so make sure you attend lectures and do the assignments. Do not procrastinate on the assignments as you will regret this when midterms or finals come around. Practice using the theorems and practice the different proofs. Midterm and final are quite reasonable if you put in the work during the term. Final has a couple computation questions which are your easy marks so make sure you get those!",Make sure you memorize all of the propositions and theorems!,A course on proofs. It surveys topics in number theory to provide examples of theorems and their proofs. The content on things like modular arithmetic and complex numbers is less useful than the practice students get writing proofs.,No help or explanations in online course just give quiz let answers,,"Really good course, make sure you do a lot of practice. But watch out, you're professor can dramatically impact your experience in this course.",
"Really good course, the base of cs245.","As a math students, much of my time was wasted in this course. We had lectures on basic knowledge such as how to calculate the slope of a line and how to read a graph. A waste of my time. Should have taken my transfer credit from AP.",UGH :( the horrors of this course will haunt me for the rest of my university life,"Very interesting course, material can be challenging but that is part of why I liked it.","Arguably the hardest course in 1A for any first year in the faculty of mathematics. You really have to put the work in to understand the concepts which are not exactly easy to grasp. Assignments take many hours, midterm was fairly easy and final was fair. Good luck to anyone taking this course, just remember not to panic, you will be fine, everyone goes through the same stage and eventually we all survive.","Really easy and useful to know, all exams are multiple choice :) very useful for understanding political platforms and world issues (also just useful if you want to do anything in business)",Easy course (if you get the right prof).,"The course forces you to really understand proof techniques, and how exactly to prove things. This idea of proving things becomes very important in the future, so it is appropriate for students to take Math 135 as an early course. Proof-type questions can either take forever because you don't know how to approach the problem or have logically consistent arguments, or they can be done very quickly if you see what exactly you need to do and you are confident with your answer. Personally, I liked the proofs portion of the course more than the computation concepts later on since the elegance and conciseness of proofs are more appealing than repetitive computations. Overall, the course does a great job of getting you into the feel of University; it could make or break you quite easily.","Similar to the review before me, I took the online version. There are zero synchronous lectures, so be prepared to spend circa 3-5 hours every week trying to memorize the course content which is presented on UW Mobius. Another peculiarity of this course is the lack of any useful practice problems. The concept checks on UW Mobius are very elementary, and they are not a representation of what you will be evaluated on during the midterm and final exam. Although this course features weekly quizzes, you only have access to your grade after completing them. As a result, you will not be able to re-visit the weekly quizzes before the assessments to learn from your mistakes.",,Assignments were generally easy. Do the practice problems throughout the term and go to res tutoring or the tutorial centre if you need help with a question. You need a 60% in the course to pass.,
"It's pretty much an introduction to computer science concepts like recursion,BSTs and other abstract data types. It's VERY useful if you have no prior experience with programming.",Introductory course to microeconomics. Not hard at all if you read the textbook and make notes. I only spent two days studying before the midterm and the final and ended up with 80+.,"Got a 60 by taking a shit on the tests, by far the most useless course in my undergrad. The ONLY things that I use are the proof techniques. All the theorems are complete garbage.",I wouldn't say it was an easy course but it is definitely manageable. Midterm was not easy but finals was quite light. Definitely the course I enjoyed the most as I learned a lot.,"Fun, but the topics get too abstract nearing the end. The first half of the course was much more enjoyable and useful imo","The averages for the midterms were in the low 70s (harder to get a higher mark because there were only 27 scantron Q's every midterm). Concepts were easy to understand - application is the harder part. Aplia isn't useful, but she did post another link to practice questions before the exam and that really helped me. You'd be OK just studying from the powerpoints. Textbook is only if you want a better grasp of concepts.","The only way to do bad in this course is by not managing ur time properly. This is a mistake I made when we had to work with modules. As long as u properly manage ur time and do assignments and concept checks well before the due date, you will have a great time in this course. Also try finding connections between assignments and try finding some real world applications of racket. Trust me Racket is very useful. The only criticism I have of this course is how the course is taught because it wasn't taught. (this is when I did online.) I had to understand all concepts by myself by basically reading texts. Although There was plenty of opportunity like office hours to ask for help, I only realized that towards the end of the term. Very unfortunate :(",Basic math knowledge.,"Took online but in person classes. My prof, Koeller, was extremely helpful, definitely the best prof I've experienced thus far. The content is relatively interesting, but the weekly written assignments were made extremely difficult and were significantly harder than the content taught in class, almost to the point of absurdity. Aside from that though this is about as interesting as math can get.",,"This course was personally very easy for me and I enjoyed it very much. You learn the foundation of theory, proofs, elementary number theory and crypto. Really try to learn from this course; the assignments are tough and the exam was half the difficulty of the assignments (which is good).",
They teach Dr Racket in this course. No one ever uses Dr Racket. This is waste of time but can't skip it either.,Hardest Class in 1A! Study until your hand hurts from those proofs. Also post midterm is much easier than pre-midterm.,Pretty cool course. They teach you a bunch of number theory and a lot of it is very interesting.,Interesting course was generally fun to learn its contents. Assignments were more difficult than midterm though...,tough course. hardest course for my first term,"im lucky i passed this course, i would never want to this ever again....",Note: The curriculum has changed since I took this course.,You gotta get used to proofs if you're a math student.,"Not a bird course online imo, instructors barely interact, and almost no practice material is given (outside of a textbook with bad quizzes).",,"Get the course notes and read through them if you're having any difficulty with any topics. Could probably just learn the whole course from the course notes, but lectures are still useful for examples and different methods. Lots of new stuff from high school, proofs scared the living daylights out of most before we got used to them, but it became easier with a bit of practice. Just a matter of getting used to the creative way of thinking. Very interesting course if you want to understand some number theory",
"Joke course if you're a CS major who is taking it just to get a good CAV (to transfer from regular to co-op, that is).",Get the study guide. You'll thank me later.,"This course is feared by many first year students and I can see why. For the people that do fail, it is mostly a case of them not adapting to university level math aka no more easy plug and chug. This is a beautiful course if you can appreciate math and logic. That being said, I did not find this course easy. Assignments take very long if you are trying to get perfect on them. That being said, I do recommend trying to get perfect on them, though sometimes it is wise to let one question go. To succeed in this course, I'd recommend reading the course notes which were super useful in understanding the basic material. Do your assignments and do well on them. Clear up all your confusions in tutorials or office hours and definitely use Piazza. A lot of students I find avoid Piazza, but in my term W2015, the profs on Piazza were amazing and almost always online. They were extremely helpful with assignments without giving answers away as long as you showed to them you were making progress and trying to solve the problem. With all this being said, I ended up doing rather poorly in this course (high 70s) for the amount of effort I put in due to doing poorly on the final. You definitely need a clear head for the exams since they involve proofs, something I lacked that day.","Very challenging course with a lot of content - requires a lot of work, but it's definitely useful and interesting for future courses.",This course kills a part of me. It is quite possibly the driest course I have taken at Waterloo so far. The hardest part of this course is trying to muster the motivation to learn about the stupidest concepts ever.,"Before midterm is every easy, but things go tough after the midterm",Sedra Smith recommended me this course so I don't end up like one of those pig 4 students. I did very well and am happy about my life choices.,A real math course. You will learn how to actually think mathematically since you probably don't know yet. An excellent course for the very foundation of math.,"Avoid the online course but, it has a nice bell curve",,"One of the more interesting math courses, difficult at first but really improves and tests logical thinking ability. Make sure to do every assignment question and fully understand the solutions to do well",
fuck i hate design recipe. your lose marks for nothing!,"you gotta at least pay attention in class, or do homework",Fascinating course that ramped up in difficulty after midterms.,Interesting yet challenging course.,One of my favorite classes of undergrad. It's very reasonable as long as you start the assignments early on your own and don't copy off of others,Really easy. I had no previous coding experience and I picked it up the concepts super quickly. You have to go to class though. Slides are NOT enough,"I like proofs. But not because of this course, but because of Math239 which is a descendant of this course. You will learn LOTS of great techniques for proofs, you may hate it or love it. I would say this usually depends on the professor. I got Shane Bauman, not sure if I liked his style, but for sure he was very energetic. Shane is a great teacher, but his pace is very fast for many. I would personally NOT recommend him since he doesn't post notes online for students to catch up. Go with profs who (may go fast with their lectures but) post their notes online.","The first part is useful, it shows me some justifications on what is different from what I learned in high school (something like 0^0=1). The second part is annoying, since I didn't learn number theory in high school, so it's hard for me to cope with difficult questions. When it goes to Prime Number, there are questions I have no idea to get full marks (question itself is easy to answer, but no idea how to avoid losing partial marks, fortunately, TAs are willing to give full marks) The third part RSA (application on number theory) is really interesting. Overall, easy course with a high grade because there are 2 free bonus marks. The final exam is hard. Some questions you have no idea how to get full marks even if you know how to solve them. If you have done many proofs in high school, easy 90+ as an online course. Just using Excel to make a calculator. EEA helps a lot.","Took this course online by Prof Wendy Roth, easy course, but felt 102 is easier than 101.",,"Was a nice way to learn recursion, which is essentially the purpose of this course. They also give a lot of free marks with a 3% lab bonus - DO THEM! That 3% can make a big difference in your mark.",
,"Not very useful as an elective, but I suppose it gives a better understanding of how markets work. It was very easy - I just had to read lecture slides. The midterms and final exam are all multiple choice.","Not an ""EASY"" course at all. Anyone commentating that is probably a Math/Eng student who is already familiar with coding through other courses. Since the midterm/exam is on paper, you have to be able to imagine what your code is going to be able to do without actually testing it like you do in your assignments! Speaking of assignment, they're bloody hard! No joke, it might take you an entire day to problem solve your way through them and that might not even be enough - incredibly frustrating course and not recommended unless you really want to study coding in the future. DR. Racket is not even applicable to most organizations. If you want to learn coding, just pick up something off Amazon or get a pdf through a friend - don't spend money here unless you're actually planning on continuing studies in CS.","Definitely a challenging course, especially if you have no prior experience with writing formal proofs. Just make sure that you practice the concepts by finding question banks online and you'll be fine!","The end of the course became quite tough but otherwise this was pretty manageable. Excellent professors and ISA's who always take our feedback and concerns into consideration to make the course experience better, including having office hours very late at night and very early in the morning. The online platform is also excellent and fun to use.",Learn nothing but gain a super high mark. Good course for those who want to switch programs or apply coop. Everything is common sense so nothing needs to memory.,"The course notes textbook make this class a breeze. Make sure you fully understand theorems, lemmas, etc if you want to do well.",the basic of math,"Can be difficult at times, but a very rewarding and fun course. Definitely made me like CS as a non-CS student! Start assignments early and definitely go to office hours. TAs and ISAs are very helpful.",,"I really enjoyed this class! It was quite difficult, but I learned a lot!",
,"Very easy course and the material was interesting enough. Dry at some points but it's just memorization for those bits. You don't need to go to lectures, you can just read the textbook and do study guide questions. Was an easy 95+.",Very useful course. Anton is a great prof who actually cares about his students. It does get hard towards the end of the course but there is always help available when you need it.,"Not easy, but what I will say is that I loved just about every concept we covered. It was truly interesting, challenging (but not challenging to the point where I felt I couldn't do it). Really just one of my favourite courses I've ever taken.","Pretty good online, First half is deceptively easy, second half gets much more difficult, especially exam. Pretty good introduction to proofs",I passed with a 75 and still don't know anything about economics,"Easy pass, just go to class.",Proofs are a pretty big shift from high school math,"Olivia Mesta was a great professor, made the material extremely clear and easy to understand. Weekly quizzes on Aplia were time consuming but helped you understand the material better. Multiple choice exams were very easy.",,"Don’t be mistaken, this course is tough. It will teach you pretty much the foundations of UW mathematics. You need to listen and spend a lot of time just thinking about the problems. Take some time with the course and you’ll enjoy it a lot.",
,"With Prof Corey (Cornelis Van De Waal), I didn't have to look in the textbook or use the workbook. I studied straight from his slides. The only case which I would have used the books is if I were aiming for a perfect 100% in the course (which is doable), but I wasn't.","This is a very well-organized course, which is great, since it is likely your first introduction to proofs, which will be absolutely central to any future math courses you take. Take note that the math in this course is very different from high school math and will probably require you to shift your thinking about mathematics from one of computation to one of puzzle-solving. Make sure to start the weekly assignments early since they can be a little unpredictable in how long they take. Also, every lecture day there is a 24-window to complete a Mobius quiz, which cumulatively count for 10% of your grade, so remember to do them (they can be easy to forget).","Pretty difficult course, but very useful for future years.",easy and light first year course,Please be very careful about the design recipe (especially tests and examples),"Highly recommend doing the readings, and assigned questions and trying to understand the course material in addition to just the prepared lecture slides. A lot of memorizing and understanding of graphs. In the end all of the content builds on itself so make sure to understand what you are learning as you are learning it. The best prep is being able to draw the graphs, and also to do the multiple choice questions in the handbook.","Could've just been the lecturer (Allison Mascella) I had, and found it hard to understand topics (since she didn't offer much clarification). You can understand topics in the real world context and therefor found it useful",it wasn't that hard but the prof made it complicated.,,"Fairly easy course overall, enjoyed the class a lot. Carrie Knoll was an excellent lecturer.",
,Wasted my elective on this when I could have taken much better courses.,"Easy course if you study, Hard course if you're too lazy to put in the time.",It is a useful course but definitely not easy if you never prove before.,Fun and useful course!,Two words: WOKIA KUMASE,"Not bad, do the modules, I didn't need the textbook","A transition course from high school math to university math. Quite a lot of important proof techniques were taught and you have to really understand the concepts and apply them other than just simply memorizing them. Proof questions in the assignments are usually much more challenging than those in the midterm/exam so don't get discouraged if you cannot solve them. Do more practices and seek help and you will be fine. Be sure that you can solve all the computational problems in the exam as they are ""easy"" marks!","I really enjoyed this course online, being co-taught by 4 professors. There were lots of office hours available to help and all of the TA's and Profs in office hours were helpful and kind. While the programming language used is not useful elsewhere, I think it is easy to understand and helped get the point of the course across. In my opinion, the point of this course is to teach you to think about solving problems and the process to go through, as you are not creating ground-breaking programs. As a student with no prior programming experience, I found this course both useful and easy if you kept up with the content and got help as soon as you needed it. The course was organized well, and the built in questions made sure you were on the right track. The assignments are fair based on what you learn. Go in with an open mind and keep up with the content and you should be just fine.",,Its not entirely easy but you learn really a lot from this course and most concepts are very fascinating. Personally I struggle more with complex numbers than number theory.,
,Interesting and easy. Make sure to do exercises after class. I dont think it is necessary to read the textbook unless you feel like to do so.,"Classes teach you nothing. Getting and reading the textbook is a must! I sat for three hours trying to keep up with the graphs being drawn and didn't have any time to comprehend what was being said. Nafeez doesn't allow photos to be taken of her notes so you couldn't even take a picture to give you time to listen. Unless you have some sort of economic background, you will be struggling through teaching yourself this course.","Learning how to do proofs...well, this course wasn't very interesting especially if you are not of the math type. Assignments are difficult. Midterm was easy and final was easy-fair though.",loved this course,,"It is an useful course but make sure you choose the right prof. Do not take with Wokia because you can't understand anything. Micro is more mathy of a course so if you are good at logic or maths, this course would be easier than macro for you. But for non mathy students, this course would be challenging. The final was difficult too.",A lot of Math that you probably didn't see in high school.,"Weekly assignments are not worth much, but are difficult. Weekly labs. 1 midterm, 1 final. Doing the labs will greatly help with the assignments. Asking questions to TAs and prof will help a lot.",,Probably my favourite course in 1A. Easy to do well in the course and the staff put the learning materials together really well. Really enjoyed this course since it teaches you about the art of problem-solving and the creative components of mathematics. If you stay on top of the material and start the psets early enough you'll do well.,

,"Read the text book, do those multiple choice questions from the study guide then you will be all set.","Weekly assignments are killer, but just be sure to get help if you fall behind. The course is not something to take lightly - the concepts are far different from the ""algebra"" you learn in high school.

Attending tutorials and doing ALL exercises is a good idea.","When I was taking this class, I had a casual conversation with my professor during which he told me that, though it starts off slow, it is actually possibly the hardest class in the maths faculty. And so I went ahead and braced myself for what was to come. To this day, I have no idea what he was talking about, and his seemingly sincere words continue to baffle me. This class was an easy ninety, and quite enjoyable as well. All the little proofs they give out are so satisfying to solve -- the same tranquil pleasure of sudoku or a crossword.

A lot of the math is new and abstract. Make sure to do as much practice as you can to familiarize with all the theorems (there are a LOT of theorems). The final exam is worth 60% so even if you do well on the weekly assignments and midterm, you still have to study hard.",

Lectures aren't the most useful, but they do give tips on how to use formulas and theorems.",
,Super easy elective. Honestly kind of a joke of a class.,"The education quality is significantly impaired with no doubt since we are doing it online. Reviews before COVID was mostly positive. But after COVID-19, a lot of them are negative. I think that reflects something. Assignment were thrown into your face like you just have one class for the whole term. For me, I believe the material we learn and the assignment we need to do is inconsistent in terms of difficulty level. The gap between them is just huge. It often took me eight to twelve hours to finish the assignment. Don't take this if you are doing online.","Personally I thought the course was really easy-- at first. But don't let yourself slack off, because otherwise you will find yourself easily confused and lost as you fall further behind. Material gets harder as course moves along. Course material is still very relevant in other courses and in the future.",it's great to have a course teaching you how to prove,,"they dont go into specifics with the maths which ironically makes it harder for me because it involves more memorization of results as opposed to memorization of concepts. might be good or bad for you instead, who knows",Welcome to Waterloo Math.,,,"Do the assignments, practice, and you'll be fine.",
,A whole lot of proofs. It is not likely that you will ever use more than 10% of the course content ever again.,My friends said this couse you can get 80+ even you are not go to class. But that is not right at all.,Useful and relevant course. Well structured and interesting.,"If you ever get Packalen, switch to another section plz lol (tough prof with short-answer exams out of 20 and doesn't give part marks)",,"In the beginning of the term this course felt very useless. However, that was the most childish a wanna be theoretical physicist can tell himself. A lot of what you will learn in this course will be useful as it will be the foundation of the mathematics you will need to solve a lot of theoretical physics problems. A lot of what u learn in this course is also useful in proving equations u derive as a physicist. You will learn things like Complex numbers, Methods of Proof, The Binomial Theory, Summations and repeated multiplications. All of these concepts are useful for example when we try to approximate equations in Physics, a good understanding of Summations is required. Binomial theory may be used to expand Relativistic kinetic energy equation. Lets say u as a mathematical physicist derived an equation some how. Now u want to make sure that the equation is valid, a basic knowledge of what u learn in this course may be helpful. Complex numbers can be spotted in Schrodinger's Wave Equation. If u are serious about physics, don't take this course lightly. Although this might be an over exaggeration but I feel like this course is as important as Calculus. So In calculus you will be asked to derive Taylor polynomials, how will you do that without a basic understanding of Summations? Although the science mathematical physics students donot have to take this course before taking math 136 (linear algebra for honours math), this course is very useful in math 136. The proof techniques you learn in this course like Proof by Strong induction may be useful in Linear algebra. And all physics enthusiasts know the importance of linear algebra in physics. One can finish most of math 137 (calculus) assignments without having to look at lectures (I donot recommend this) and get a good grade. You cannot even solve the first question in math 135 before fully understanding all concepts in the lectures. I personally very much disliked this course mostly because the math learned was very new compared to what I was taught in school and it was difficult to understand these ideas. But I did enjoy learning about the new concepts. but I understand that the content taught is very important. Therefore, if u are an apprising physicist, take the course seriously. If u like pure math take this course seriously, if u like CS take this course seriously. If u like Finance take this course seriously. If u like painting take this course seriously (u need to understand the golden ratio to figure out how to make ur art perfect). Regardless of ur major, please don't undermine the value this course provides. This course sucks no doubt, but it is hella useful so pay attention in class and do all assignments even though u can drop one. A criticism I would have with this course is the lack of applications. Although this course content has many applications the course is designed in a way that suggests that there is none except in pure math. I would like that to change. And if possible please make a physics based Math135 and math 136 please and thankyou.","A nice intro to coding, especially for those who probably won't take more in upper years; it's good to know the basics.",,,good course but requires alot of studying not as bird of a course as people think!,
,Bird course.,"Go to the TA's for extra help(they offer free private sessions) and the class is not so bad, even for first time computer science students!",It is definitely one of the most interesting courses in my first year as it is the course that has the most new content compared to the other courses. The course was certainly challenging though I'd give it that but I did learn a lot from it. The most important thing about the course I'd say is PRACTICE!,Should be a breeze and quite fun if you love competition math and proofs. Loved the number theory the most.,,This course can go fuck itself,,,,"The first 2/3 of this course made lots of sense, the last 1/3 I really struggled with.",
,"Took this in 2018 with no programming experience ever. Started out pretty slow, but I didn't really pay attention and was severely behind. Went to a lot of office hours, but nonetheless caught up and did decently well. After taking more cs courses, racket really is a weird language.",Bird course nuff said.,I had no programming experience before this class and it still wasn't too hard for the most part. A good elective. Some assignments were tricky but the exams were easy.,"I don't like math. I'm a CS and code guy, not a math guy. However, all the profs I've interacted with in this course (I had Yu-Ru and Anton the course coordinator is just amazing) are lovely. They help you out and you feel cared. It does get really hard at the end though. Make sure you go to Yu-Ru's office hours if you can because she gives so many helpful hints there.",,"I loved everything about cs 115. Great instructors, fair assignments ( can get tricky but there's a huge amount of office hours to attend ), good engagement and interesting topics! It's seriously well structured and I would recommend it to anyone even with no background in coding.",,,,This course was my favorite in first year. It's really fun. I enjoyed writing codes a lot.,
,Read the coursenote and only go to class for clicker questions,"CS 115's content wasn't too hard and is very accessible to first time coders. Be prepared to sometimes have to put in a good chunk of time for the weekly assignments, but the assignments help you out a lot with problem solving skills and becoming more comfortable with coding in general.","Easy introduction to mathematical thinking and proofs. Assignments were somewhat difficult and long but not worth very much, and were definitely good practice. Midterm was extremely easy and final was quite a bit trickier. Study the later content, and congruences and gcd, really well for the final. Also do the posted practice problems. It can also help to have a good prof in this course and/or read the textbook and most importantly, lots of practice with proofs every week.","Thanks to Keiko Katsuragawa, the prof who doesn't know how to type properly or speak English at a comprehensive level, I can't stand this easy CS course. Very prof dependent, but generally easy.",,Strongly recommend purchasing Aplia. A bad midterm grade can nerf your mark since they go for 25% apiece.,,,,Do the Myeconlab practice problems and this course should be an easy 90% for you.,
,So boring,"One of my least favourite courses. Although things were nicely organized, Racket was such an annoying language to use. The one tangible benefit I felt after using Racket was feeling more comfortable with recursion.","I found this course to be quite difficult, but my profs, Yu Ru Liu and Wentang Kuo, made it bearable with their office hours; 10/10 will take any course with either of them again!","It'd be awesome to be good at this stuff, it's pretty interesting. Material covered is completely new however and the course moves at too quick of a pace",,A starting course for CS noobs like me....XD,,,,"The concepts are easy, but the applications are difficult. The problems on assignments and exams are fun, but challenging (and very rewarding when you finally get it right).",
,"Read the textbook, it is a godsend",Incredibly helpful for anyone who wants to develop a more profound understanding of the fundamental components of algebra.,"A solid, and worthwhile course to teach you the fundamentals of mathematical proofs. The hard work is definitely worth it!","Purely memorization. Very little bit of arithmetic, but its mostly just knowing how to read supply/demand graphs that's the most technical part.",,"didn't like it, I was lucky I passed",,,,I found this course hard as I often felt like I understood the concepts but couldn't discover the proof. Do a lot of practice!,
,"Light workload. Do the readings, MyEconLab helped .","It was okay. All I can say is, do your work and submit assessments on time. Please don't procrastinate. That's what I did, and I live to regret it. This is because figuring out the solutions to each assessment problem takes time, and procrastinating doesn't help. So, submit early. Submit often. Submit. Submit.",Genuinely easy course...,Choose a prof that only give mc in the exam,,Very simple,,,,"taught terribly, seems so unorganized and the actual midterm/exam questions are different to the ones you use on pearson.",
,Honestly a waste of course.,,"If you want something to initially challenge your ability to understand and use logic, you will enjoy this course",Elementary course in CS. Have fun!,,,,,,Assignment questions take some thinking to get. Fun course that challenges us to think more.,
,,,easy course,"A good introductory course into CS (IMO CS 100 doesn't count because it's about making an ancient website or something like that). A little difficult at first, but once you get into it, and get into the CS way of thinking it's pretty easy. It also gives you a better appreciation for the stuff programmers do, and allows you to understand their work better.",,,,,,"make sure you realllllyyyy listen during the lectures...if you miss something you'll have to go back and teach it to yourself. To be honest, I learned more from Khan Academy about economics than I did from this course. There are multiple midterms, a final, and numerous ""assignments"" (just quizzes on Learn that don't have a time limit), and they are all multiple choice. I personally did not find some of the concepts easy unless I reviewed them over and over again, but I also would zone out a lot during lectures so if you listen attentively and practice you should be okay. Clicker questions can boost your mark too and are good for teamwork, easy enough to do well on. Overall mediocre course",
,,,Realized how good this course was after the term I finished it. Go through the material thoroughly and the most important part in the course is understanding the definitions and solve as many problems as you can.,"I love the encryption part, it's just amazing how effective you can encrypt things with just so little effort and it takes decades to factor it!",,,,,,"Really interesting but tough material. If you can, go to the lectures of the highly rated professors. It's a completely different type of math from HS math and calculus so having a great prof introduce you to these new ideas can make it much more enjoyable. Oh and practice practice practice.",
,,,Do your assignments with a buddy. Was a bit difficult near the end but very rewarding course.,First half up to the midterm was easy,,,,,,"It's easy if you know how to study properly (did not do this until the final, so didnt do too great). Just STUDY FROM and MEMORIZE the practice questions/exam bank. Seriously a lot of the questions on the final are suuuper similar and sometimes even word for word exact numbers. So basically, you arent supposed to try and actually learn the content, just memorize. Really dumb since people dont retain the knowledge but easy mark if you just memorize the exam bank.",
,,,"Actual content is kind of interesting but the course is easy, just read from the textbook",i hate racket,,,,,,Easily my favourite course at UW.,
,,,"Very easy till the midterm. After that, they go Super Saiyan mode and give hard af assignments. Very interesting tho. The profs are working hard on the online version.",,,,,,,"Chose professor carefully, one professor has an open-ended midterms and finals. Besides that, pretty much a bird course.",
,,,not too hard in terms of material. pretty boring especially for 3 hour lectures. not really useful for future econ classes but a good mark booster.,,,,,,,Do the practice problems.,
,,,Proofs were difficult but adequately prepares you for math courses in the future!,,,,,,,teaches you how to think,
,,,"This course is an introduction to proofs. I remember it being very difficult to grasp some concepts, and I spent a long time on assignments. But what you learn in this course is quite important for upper years. I took it in Fall 2020, online.",,,,,,,"I think MATH 135 is a crucial course if you're doing anything proof related. It lays the foundation for proofs, which will be needed throughout uni if you're doing any math related program. It's not the easiest course, so pay attention in lectures, ask question and practice, practice, practice.",
,,,"Like it. It is a good review of high-school economic class. The content is not hard at all, as long as you spend some time reading the concepts. Quizzes and tests are not hard, a joyful course, no pressure",,,,,,,I really don't like the way this course was taught. I found the professor to be lacking in enthusiasm and lectures were literally reading the slides out loud.,
