The design recipe and templates are the hardest thing for the majority of the course. Assignments get a little harder at the end but both the midterm and finals were easy.,"This course was definitely the one that set me up with programming. The difficulty of this course starts to increase after the midterm exam. If you feel like you have sufficient Computer Science experience, go to CS 135 because it does challenge you more.",Really easy course. Especially if you have coded before. Assignments get a little harder at the end but both the midterm and finals were easy. The only thing I hated about this course was how annoying using Dr. Racket can be at times. i hate racket fuck i hate design recipe. your lose marks for nothing!
"This course is great for anyone that is interested in math. It is quite different from high school math courses. The final exam is worth 60% so even if you do well on the weekly assignments and midterm, you still have to study hard.","This course teaches a completely new concept for most, proofs. The final exam is worth 60% so even if you do well on the weekly assignments and midterm, you still have to study hard.","Got a 60 by taking a shit on the tests, by far the most useless course in my undergrad. The ONLY things that I use are the proof techniques. All the theorems are complete garbage."
The majority of the midterm and final questions (all MC) are from test banks if you can get those. Assignments get a lot harder after the midterms. Concepts were easy to understand - application is the harder part.,This course is interesting and easy before the midterm. Still interesting after the midterm but it is super hard. I took it twice and still couldn't get a good grade. Exams are much easier than the assignments.,"Still get the chills from Econ 101, worst mark in my academic career. Still get thechills from Econ 101, worst mark in my academic career."
"This course really expands my thinking as a mathematician. Midterm was extremely easy and final was quite a bit trickier. Anton is just absolutely goated -- if you have the chance, join in on one of his lectures.","If you were even a bit serious about contest maths in high school, this course is an easy 90+. Learned a lot on how to properly write proofs and different mathematical ways of thinking.","Was my favourite course in 1A, taught you a different way of thinking. The midterm was setup poorly - the focus was not on core concepts but on the exactness of the stepping problems."
"Easiest course I've ever taken. Trust the test bank and you'll end up with high 90s Various concepts were interesting, but unless you are prepared to work for it, it's not very easy.","SO easy, didn't pay attention in the lectures, just used course notes. Easy bird course for any student looking to fill an elective. Course goes over a lot of concepts in a super broad manner.","Nafeez doesn't allow photos to be taken of her notes so you couldn't even take a picture to give you time to listen. Unless you have some sort of economic background, you will be struggling through teaching yourself this course."
Interesting course. Assignments can be challenging so start those as soon as possible. Midterm and Final were straightforward. Probably my favourite course in 1Alectures.,"Great introduction to math@UW! Loved the number theory the most. First half is deceptively easy, second half gets much more difficult. Anton Mosunov is the GOAT.",Not my favorite class. Material was not interesting and the midterm/final were very difficult in comparison to the practice and quizzes. Went through chapters just about every other class so it was very fast paced.
"The most important thing about the course I'd say is PRACTICE! It's the worst course ever, online especially. Can be difficult at times, but a very rewarding and fun course.",The only way to do bad in this course is by not managing ur time properly. Start assignments early and definitely go to office hours. Anton is a great prof who actually cares about his students.,"This course is taught in an archaic language that no one uses and no one understands. Instructors' explanations are irrelevant to actual questions. Assignments and quizzes are unreasonably hard. If you don't need this course, run."
"math student who took this course since I had 0 prior programming experience. Because the course was only offered online, I had to essentially had to teach the whole course to myself Pretty interesting course.","math student who took this course since I had 0 prior programming experience. The racket language used in this course is easy to follow but not very useful. There were a lot of erroneous questions (like two MCQ choices are the same) on the quizzes, midterms and final.","Not a bird course online imo, instructors barely interact, and almost no practice material is given. Learn nothing but gain a super high mark. Good course for those who want to switch programs or apply coop."
